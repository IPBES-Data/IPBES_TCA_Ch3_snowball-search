TI  - Transforming universities Mobilizing research and education for sustainability transitions at Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The dominant model of universities, especially in the social sciences, is often based upon academic disciplines, objectivity, and a linear knowledge-transfer model. It facilitates competition between academics, educating students for specific professions from an objective, descriptive, and neutral position. This paper argues that this institutional model of universities is inadequate to contribute effectively to societal transitions towards just and sustainable futures. Taking the Erasmus University Rotterdam (EUR), the Netherlands, as an example, this paper illustrates the problems with the dominant (twentieth century) model of universities in the social sciences and explores what strategies universities can develop to transform. It introduces the notions of transformative research and transformative education: transdisciplinary, collaborative, and action-oriented academic work that explicitly aims to support societal transitions. It presents the design impact transition (DIT) platform as an 'institutional experiment' at the EUR and a concerted and strategic effort that lays bare current lock-ins of the dominant university model and the kind of institutional work needed to transform universities.

TI  - Strategic visions for local sustainability transition: measuring maturity in Swedish municipalities
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY & PLANNING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The use of strategic visions based on concepts like climate-neutrality, net-zero emissions and energy efficiency is important to align action and build momentum. The agency of transition actors requires clear definitions and explanations of visions, enabling operationalization for action, monitoring and measuring of results. This paper develops a maturity scale for climate-related strategic visions among local governments. Further, the maturity of Swedish municipalities' climate-related strategic visions is reviewed. The results show that out of Sweden's 290 municipalities, 256 shows overall low maturity in their strategic visions, not supporting their local, regional and national system actors sufficiently. Furthermore, results from workshops indicate that the roles, mandate and process for working with municipal strategic visions are not clear. There is an ambiguity around visions that is hindering aligned action and progress.

TI  - Unlocking and accelerating transformations to the SDGs: a review of existing knowledge
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - As we cross the 2030 deadline to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), there is a growing sense of urgency around the need to accelerate the necessary transformations. These encompass a broad range of systems and require fundamental changes in system goals and design. In this paper, we undertake a narrative review of the literature relating to the acceleration of transformations and offer a framework for unlocking and accelerating transformations to the SDGs. While there is no blueprint for acceleration, there is an expanding knowledge base on important dynamics, impediments and enabling conditions across diverse literatures which can help to inform strategic interventions by actors. The emerging literature on positive tipping points and deep leverage points identifies opportunities to rewire systems design so that important system feedbacks create the conditions for acceleration. Transformation takes time and actors will need to build momentum to reorient systems around new goals, informed by knowledge of common policy, technology and behavioural feedbacks that govern system dynamics. Where resistance is strong, actors can seek to augment system design in ways that weaken balancing feedbacks that stabilise existing system configurations and strengthen reinforcing feedbacks that promote emerging system configurations oriented towards the SDGs. Well-designed and sequenced interventions can promote innovation and behaviour change and build and maintain political support. This can build critical enabling conditions and push systems towards large-scale tipping points, paving the way for decisive policy action that is crucial for triggering acceleration. We conclude by highlighting gaps and priorities for further research.

TI  - How does learning drive sustainability transitions? Perspectives, problems and prospects from a systematic literature review
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Review
AB  - Learning has been put forward as a critical aspect to achieve sustainable transformation of so-cietal systems. However, there is a lack of a systematic review of empirical evidence on how learning is related to sustainability transitions. To bridge this gap, we systematically reviewed 113 empirical papers that addressed the role of learning in transitions. Our results show that the complexity of the relationship between learning and transitions is not deeply analysed and that there is a need to distinguish more precisely between learning processes and learning outcomes. Further, there is a need to shift the focus towards analysing regime-level learning to increase our understanding of how learning contributes to system transformation. Finally, networks, trust, disagreement, and power are key aspects related to learning that will require further examination, especially in terms of how they play out dynamically in learning for sustainability transitions.

TI  - Politics beyond agency? Pluralizing structure(s) in sustainability transitions
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - What exactly do transition scholars mean by structure? In efforts to articulate the politics of sustainability transitions, scholarship has en masse turned to unraveling and pluralizing the many different manifestations of agency and power in processes of transformative change. While this is valuable, such an agency-centered focus risks de-politicizing the role of structure in studies on the politics of transitions. This perspective explores the plurality of interpretations of structure presented in transitions research. Transitions research, perhaps paradoxically, considers structure to be (1) concrete or elusive; (2) a verb or a noun; (3) the medium or conditions for action; (4) internal or external to agents; (5) influenceable or contextual; (6) hierarchical or relational; and (7) stabilizing or transformative. Such a non-exhaustive overview of different interpretations of structure portrays the richness of the field, and could help scholars to reflect upon their assumptions when engaging with the concept of 'structure'. Finally, it provides pathways for re-politicizing structure, by articulating the different ways in which structure can be considered (a)political. Re-politicization requires governance efforts to more explicitly engage with the politics of structures. This entails de-constructing existing and oppressive structures that reinforce incumbencies and unjust dynamics, while embracing the transformative power of democratically designed structures that might help us to accelerate transformative change.

TI  - The quest for game changers- Review of new trends and innovations in the design of large-scale energy systems
T2  - ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper presents a subjective review of emerging trends and innovations in the design of large-scale energy systems. The main research question is how societies are responding to serious concerns about climate change, access to resources, access to energy, and economic development. The aim of the study is twofold. Firstly, it aims at the identification of major changes and emerging novelties that may have an impact on the functioning of modern societies and the future shape of energy systems. Secondly, the aim is to present the increasing complexity and multidimensionality of the issues related to the planning and design of energy systems. In order to achieve the objectives, a short development history and the key features of large-scale energy systems are presented in the first place. Then, the AARTT review framework is proposed, which groups trends and in-novations into five respective categories, namely: Awareness, Approaches, Resources, Technologies, and Tools. Within each category up to date literature, reports and projects have been reviewed, and as a result, a mind map has been built, which depicts key innovations. In the last part of the paper, a vision of the future energy system is created based on key findings of the literature review. It addresses the identified innovations and development trends as well as the fact that the global energy transition is noticeably accelerating. It is concluded that the fate of our future doesn't depend solely on technologies but rather a holistic approach and concerted multi-and interdisciplinary activities are required.

TI  - Can southern Europe lead an urban energy transition? Insights from the Energy Transition Roundtable in Valencia, Spain
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-stakeholder engagement spaces are important instruments for transition governance. Due to their nature they require acute consciousness of the local context and place they are based in. The research presented in this paper adds to the body of literature on how to govern the energy transition at a local level, and contributes to filling the gap on the role of multi-stakeholder engagement groups in the energy transition process within a southern European context. Empirical evidence is drawn from the city of Valencia, Spain, where innovative formulas are being developed. One such innovation, the Mesa de Transici ' on Energe ' tica (MTE - Energy Round Table), emerges as a multi-stakeholder, participatory and inclusive mechanism to define the roadmap towards achieving the energy transition and urban sustainability. This new experience in the city led to the discovery and exploration of the challenges, barriers, benefits and opportunities the city had to face, as well as clarifying how such multi-stakeholder engagement spaces can facilitate the energy transition path. The research evidenced that while participants and organizers were very satisfied with the development of the stakeholder group and the resulting demonstration projects used to enhance experimentation in the city, they signaled various difficulties. Such difficulties were rooted in the context and included dealing with an uneven vision of the transition, the vulnerability of the group due to the predominant role of the local administration, and a perceived lack of action. Nevertheless, the multi-stakeholder engagement space for the energy transition in Valencia can be seen as an important driver of change for the city. It can also be seen as an experimental model to be replicated in other Spanish or southern European cities.

TI  - Toward a systemic approach to energy transformation in Algeria
T2  - EURO-MEDITERRANEAN JOURNAL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the drivers of Algeria's energy transformation as well as the cross-cutting issues and challenges in the transformation process. It suggests a framework that accelerates sustainable transformation based on the ideologies of systemic reasoning. Interviews were conducted with 20 energy experts in Algeria, along with a content analysis of policy documents, reports, and previous studies. The rate of government investment in the sector, level of awareness of the importance of the transition, nature of the market, and governance were revealed as critical drivers of Algeria's energy transformation process. However, the process is hindered by a highly centralized and less systemic approach to managing the transformation, unstable policies, low levels of awareness of the relevance of renewable energy (RE), and poor market regulation. The study recommends a set of target indicators for assessing Algeria's energy transformation across economic sustainability, sociopolitical, environmental, and market dimensions to facilitate sustainable attainment of the country's energy transformation pathway. It suggests, therefore, in its framework, that Algeria's current policy priorities, existing regulations, and market performance should be reviewed to facilitate the successful realization of the country's energy transformation.

TI  - What derives renewable energy transition in G-7 and E-7 countries? The role of financial development and mineral markets
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The enduring impact of the synergy between environmental sustainability and natural resources varies across countries depending on the economic structure. Though the transboundary effect of mineral resources and cleaner energy underlines the significance of environmental performance, this research aims to scrutinize this inclusive theme by investigating the dynamic effects of mineral markets, and financialization on energy transition in selected developed and developing countries from 1990 to 2019. The cross-sectional autoregressive distributive lags (CS-ARDL) model is applied to address slope heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependency. The empirical findings reveal that mineral markets significantly contribute to the energy transition process in accomplishing low-carbon power generation in G-7 countries. In contrast, financial development negatively influences energy transition; however, it has an insignificant effect on the E-7 countries. The study outcomes are verified by employing the augmented mean group (AMG) and common correlated effect mean group (CCEMG) estimators. These findings provide valuable policy recommendations for all stakeholders to drive the transition of renewable energy toward low carbon and green growth.

TI  - Exploring visions and vision clusters of sustainable food packaging- The case of Finland
T2  - FUTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - Food packaging faces demands to reduce its ecological footprint, e.g., plastic leakage and use of virgin materials. We collected and analyzed stakeholder visions of sustainable food packaging in Finland. The food packaging system's complexity means that a single, tangible, transformative, and widely acceptable vision can be difficult to create. We therefore present a "vision cluster" as a concept for analyzing and presenting visions. The visions are considered from two interrelated perspectives: the breadth of the change referring to the diversity of actors involved; and the depth of change referring to the type of change, including structures, human-nature connections, and knowledge systems. Different visions complement each other and create an opportunity to discuss potential tensions between visions and actors. A vision cluster could alleviate conflict, allowing different actors to consider various sustainable futures together, and the possible tensions may be openly discussed. There were clear differences in the prominence of actors in the visions. Although the food industry is a major food packaging actor, it is less visible than the packaging industry in the visions. The changes in food packaging were often envisioned as relatively shallow or incremental. However, increasing collaboration between different actors was a recurring theme in the visions.

T2  - BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Goal-based corporate supply chain commitments to zero-deforestation, carbon neutrality, or sustainable sourcing have become important elements of businesses' sustainability and reputation management practices. However, we still know little about the conditions under which such cross-temporal commitments are likely to be successful. This article introduces commitment credibility as a crucial but understudied antecedent of success. Drawing on the economic theory of imagined futures, it shows how cross-temporal signaling via commitments may change suppliers' expectations and related actions and thereby co-create more sustainable futures. By using insights from credible commitment theory, it argues that this pathway relies on high motivational and/or imperative credibility of the committed company. Contrasting the example of zero-deforestation commitments in the palm oil sector with commitments to sustainable seafood and no farmworker exploitation, it highlights that the involvement of critical stakeholders (as external accountability partners or third-party implementing agents) is of particularly high importance for on-the-ground success.

TI  - The politics of expertise in assessing alternatives to glyphosate in France
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Transitions to sustainability require not only structural policy reforms, but a rethinking of how policy-relevant expertise is produced. Scholars of Science and Technology Studies have used the concept of boundary work to examine how governments mobilize experts to establish epistemic and political authority for public policies. Less attention has been paid to the ways in which boundary work affects the scope of policy options to advance sustainability transitions, notably in the context of sociotechnical lock-in of dominant technologies. This article analyzes French pesticide regulation on alternatives to glyphosate in agriculture to reveal the governance implications of the construction of expertise. It examines how state actors and scientific experts performed cognitive and sociopolitical boundary work to affect both the framing of government-commissioned scientific reports and the institutions and policy instruments through which the government addressed the glyphosate problem. The article analyzes the factors that shaped the development of a novel regulatory instrument which restricts the use of glyphosate based on the availability and costs of alternatives, rather than on health or environmental risks alone. This process limited the framing of glyphosate alternatives to practices considered economically and practically feasible by selected experts and excluded more systemic alternatives from policy debate and instrumentation. The adoption of this regulatory instrument reflects specific institutional contexts, power differentials between governmental ministries, and the hidden political influence of a powerful agricultural sector and agrochemical industry. This article shows how expertise design plays a key role in defining the scope of policy options and determining allocations of political power.

TI  - Reconciling welfare policy and sustainability transition - A case study of the Finnish welfare state
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNANCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The paper investigates the capacity of welfare policies to support sustainability transitions. Welfare policy involves the discussion on public and private responsibilities and choices in public spending. The Finnish government's decision to turn Finland into a carbon neutral welfare society by 2035 is interpreted as a possible sustainability transition. The government launched a social security reform at the same time as the carbon neutrality target was announced. It was assumed that one of the major reforms would be utilised to achieve the carbon neutrality target. The research material consists of administrative, policy and political documents. The chosen documents describe how the issues are presented in policymaking. The qualitative analyses focused on the frames. It was examined how the current problems of the system were framed because the frames guide the possible solutions. According to our analysis, the Finnish government showed strong political will for sustainability transition. However, one of its major reforms was not utilised to create policies to support the shift towards a carbon neutral welfare society. The political will did not convert into action on the social security reform. The main reason seems to be related to the strongly guiding legislative frame in the reform. The legislative frame impacted on the utilised knowledge, which focused solely on the system level of social security. It could have been useful to utilise research knowledge about large-scale reforms and how to formulate them cross-sectionally.

TI  - Long-term trends in settlement persistence in Southwest Asia: Implications for sustainable urbanism, past, present and future
T2  - URBAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Southwest Asia saw the emergence of large settlements in the Early Holocene, and the world's first urban communities around 6000 years ago, with cities a feature of the region ever since. These developed in diverse environmental settings, including the dry-farming plains of Northern Mesopotamia, the irrigated alluvium of Southern Mesopotamia and the more variegated landscapes of the Levant. In this paper we use a dataset of several hundred sites dating from the earliest large sites around 12,000 years ago to the Classical period (2000 BP), to examine trends in settlement sustainability through time. We use persistence of occupation as a proxy for sustainability and compare settlement trajectories in different land use zones. Comparing cities and settlements at these spatial and temporal scales allows us to address a key question in the New Urban Agendas framework: how urban development can best be supported by sustainable use of land. We find that the highest levels of persistence were not uniformly associated with high agricultural productivity regions, and some of the longest-lived settlements are located in marginal environments, likely at critical points in transport networks. We also find that persistence is enhanced in landscapes which do not require large-scale capital investment or specific forms of economic and social organisation to maintain high levels of agricultural productivity, and that sustainability is inversely correlated with social complexity. Our results show that the millennial timescales available through archaeology can enable us to identify the political, social and ecological conditions required for large centres to persist through time.

TI  - (Re)framing technology: The evolution from biogas to biomethane in Austria
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Socio-technical niches are often presented as key drivers for transitioning established production and consumption systems to more sustainable configurations. In previous research, the important roles of collectively shared expectations in shaping the development and nurturing of such niches has been emphasised. At the same time, this research has shown that niches are often associated with fluctuating expectations, typically showing patterns of hype and disappointment. In this study, we analyse how such hype and disappointment patterns interact with framing dynamics by combining the concept of technological frames with the sociology of expectations and the multilevel perspective. By using the shift in understanding that has occurred from a 'biogas' to a 'biomethane' frame in the Austrian anaerobic digestion (AD) niche as an example, we shed light on niche-internal framing struggles, illustrate the normative character of technological frames, and relate the emergence of dominant frames to hype cycle and transition dynamics.

TI  - Testing Food Waste Reduction Targets: Integrating Transition Scenarios with Macro-Valuation in an Urban Living Lab
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bristol, one of the United Kingdom's (UK) nine Core Cities, is seeking to achieve Zero Waste City status by 2049. This study combines macro-economic valuation with transition pathway mapping and adapted participatory scenario planning to stress test the city's ambitious food waste targets. The primary aim is to enable better understanding of who might be affected by achieving these targets, both locally and nationally, the potential scale of impacts, and therefore the potential barriers and policy opportunities. The valuation focuses on household and commercial food waste, combining available site and city data with national level proxies. Impact areas include changes in sectoral income, employee income, capital owner income, tax revenue, and carbon emissions. Four scenarios, based on two extreme cases, are modelled to consider food waste reduction and potential shifts in consumption patterns. Results indicate that current market and governance failures incentivise waste, and suggest potential routes to transition, including trade-offs and resource reallocation, alongside the need to acknowledge and respond to these profound structural barriers. With further development and testing, the approach may contribute to a better understanding of how to achieve city socioenvironmental targets.

TI  - Reclaiming the city from an urban vitalism perspective: critically reflecting smart, inclusive, resilient and sustainable just city labels
T2  - CITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyses four of the most prominent city discourses and introduces the lens of urban vitalism as an overarching interdisciplinary concept of cities as places of transformation and change. We demonstrate the value of using urban vitalism as a lens to conceptualize and critically discuss different notions on smart, inclusive, resilient and sustainable just cities. Urban vitalism offers a process-based lens which enables us to understand cities as places of transformation and change, with people and other living beings at its core. The aim of the article is to explore how the lens of vitalism can help us understand and connect ongoing interdisciplinary ac-ademic debates about urban development and vice versa, and how these ongoing debates inform our under-standing of urban vitalism.

TI  - Change and path dependency in expanding energy systems: Explaining Peru?s energy transition beyond a North-South divide
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Energy research often differentiates between energy systems in the Global South and the Global North. We argue that this differentiation, which shifts the focus on deficiencies for systems in the Global South, hampers the identification of opportunities for change towards sustainable energy supply and limits our understanding of energy transition processes. We argue that from a socio-technical perspective immanent characteristics of energy systems instead of predefined country categories should guide empirical research. Subsequently, we develop and test the conception of expanding energy systems, which stand for systems with an increase in electricity gen-eration and territorial coverage. We argue that these expansion processes in combination have important im-plications for energy transition. We integrate the conception of expansion in a socio-technical, neo-institutional understanding of energy systems. To test the applicability, we analyse change and path dependency in the energy system of Peru. We explore different processes of renewable energy expansion: a massive distribution of solar home systems, a projected expansion of large-scale hydropower, and a local niche of the production and use of solar water heaters. The results show how embedded actors and institutions strive for continuity and shape expansions. However, the results also indicate in what way the momentum of expansion is a window of op-portunity for socio-technical change. We see a valuable contribution of the differentiation of expanding energy systems to the understanding of energy transitions and advocate for a further development of the concept.

TI  - A turn to geopolitics: Shifts in the German energy transition discourse in light of Russia?s war against Ukraine
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Germany's Energiewende is often considered a role model for the transition to renewable energy. And notwithstanding some domestic disputes about costs and practical implementation, it enjoys broad multiparty and multisector commitment. However, Russia's 2022 war against Ukraine marks a turning point in Germany's energy politics. We examine the war's repercussions on the Energiewende discourse drawing on newspaper articles, tweets, talk shows, and parliamentary speeches published shortly after the beginning of the war. We show that economic, environmental, and technological considerations become complicated by a new emphasis on security, freedom, and sovereignty. We identify four discursive shifts caused by this turn to geopolitics: 1) There is renewed controversy about whether gas imports slowed down the Energiewende or were necessary to support it. This weakens the discursive consensus on the desirability of the Energiewende. 2) In light of the new moral imperative for reducing dependence on Russian gas, the ecological modernization paradigm is challenged. 3) Lignite, nuclear power, and LNG are in contradiction to the goals of the Energiewende, but gain popularity as bridging technologies because they promise to increase supply security. 4) At the same time, additional funding for, and an accelerated implementation of renewable energy is justified by the new emphasis on security, freedom, and sovereignty. While it is too early to tell whether those discursive shifts will overall strengthen or weaken Germany's energy transition in the long run, they are important to understand political conflicts about the future of the project and its international repercussions.

TI  - Biodiversity policy integration in five policy sectors in Germany: How can we transform governance to make implementation work?
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Drivers for biodiversity loss are largely regulated by policies in non-environmental sectors. The limited main-streaming of biodiversity into respective policies remains yet to be analysed. During the process of updating the German National Biodiversity Strategy, we conducted 33 interviews and a stakeholder workshop to analyse barriers and levers for biodiversity integration in five policy sectors: agriculture, forests, marine & coastal areas, business & industries, rural & urban development. Based on Biodiversity Policy Integration literature, we distinguish four leverage points for transformation related to inclusive, integrated, accountable and adaptive governance. We found that biodiversity inclusive narratives and innovative approaches exist but are over-shadowed by conflicting vested interests. Dominant sector policies are incoherent and continue to provide harmful subsidies. Institutional structures fail to reflexively respond to ambitious agendas and are locked into sector specific accountability hierarchies. Thus, transformative national planning needs to overcome institutional lock-ins and empower agents to develop innovative solutions.

TI  - Making sense of power through transdisciplinary sustainability research: insights from a Transformative Power Lab
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - If transdisciplinary sustainability research is to contribute to sustainability transitions, issues of power dynamics need to be understood and accounted for. However, examples of concrete methods that put this into practice are sparse. This paper presents a conceptual and methodological framework that develops a better understanding of the power phenomenon, while providing actionable knowledge. By focussing on the context of social innovation in energy transitions, we demonstrate how different theoretical conceptualisations of power can be translated into a collaborative, transdisciplinary research design. In a facilitated process, researchers, policy workers and practitioners from diverse social innovation fields developed and tested the Transformative Power Lab approach and co-wrote a 'Power Guide' as a strategic exploration of power dynamics in sustainability transitions, specifically regarding social innovation in energy transitions. Based on the insights that emerged during this process, we discuss how transdisciplinary and action-oriented approaches in sustainability transition studies might benefit from this approach and, potentially, develop it further.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last millennium BCE, central places were founded across many regions of western (non-Maya) Mesoamerica. These early central places differed in environmental location, size, layout, and the nature of their public spaces and monumental architecture. We compare a subset of these regional centers and find marked differences in their sustainability--defined as the duration of time that they remained central places in their respective regions. Early infrastructural investments, high degrees of economic interdependence and collaboration between domestic units, and collective forms of governance are found to be key factors in such sustainability.

TI  - Learning systems and learning paths in sustainability transitions
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Scholars have stressed the need to better understand the role of learning in sustainability transitions. Even though progress has been made, there is a call for more research, both in the form of large-scale empirical studies and theoretical clarity. Based on pragmatic learning theory, this paper responds to this call by presenting the results of an empirical study on learning within the context of a European large-scale multi-level transition-oriented sustainability project. Following the empirical analysis of the learning in this project, the concept of a learning system is proposed as a theoretical innovation, and the question of how to most effectively facilitate learning in sustainability transitions is rephrased as how such a learning system is best designed. Moreover, the term "learning path" is introduced to describe how individuals or groups maneuver within a learning system. We argue that to understand this maneuvering, the focus needs to be directed at the perceived learning needs of the actors relative to the challenges they are experiencing. Finally, the article discusses how to improve learning in sustainability transition projects and points to the potential value of using the concepts of learning systems and learning paths in doing so.

TI  - Comparing Societal Impact Planning and Evaluation Approaches across Four Urban Living Labs (in Food-Energy-Water Systems)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Achieving societal impact, as opposed to academic impact, is a growing area of focus for the research community globally. Central to this changing mission is the focus on multiple interconnected complex systems and the need for research that is not just interdisciplinary, but also transdisciplinary and grounded in stakeholder co-production. This document compares multiple approaches to impact planning and evaluation across four newly formed urban living labs in Sao Paolo (Brazil), Western Cape (South Africa), Bristol (UK) and Rotterdam (Netherlands), each of which sought to address societal issues linked to the food-energy-water nexus. A comparison matrix and a disaggregated impact table are derived from a comprehensive review of key definitions. These new tools were completed by each ULL alongside a post hoc pathway to impact statements. Comparisons are presented and discussed, the strengths and weaknesses of this approach are considered and opportunities for improvement in societal impact planning and evaluation are provided. Our main findings include the importance of establishing clear shared definitions while accepting plural understandings, the need to acknowledge resource as a critical factor in impact delivery and the headline need for far greater focus in this area from both funders and research groups.

TI  - Nature-Based Solutions as Building Blocks for the Transition towards Sustainable Climate-Resilient Food Systems
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Food systems-encompassing food production, transportation, processing and consumption, including food losses and waste-are currently not delivering what is expected or needed to ensure their full contribution to societal well-being and ecological sustainability. In this paper, we hypothesize that nature-based solutions (NBS; solutions that are inspired by, supported by, or copied from nature) can overcome system challenges related to the functioning of the biosphere, society, or economy (including governance arrangements), and support a transition to sustainable climate-resilient food systems. We develop a conceptual framework to assess NBS contributions to such transitions. Three types of NBS are evaluated: intrinsic NBS which make use of existing ecosystems; hybrid NBS which manage and adapt ecosystems; and inspired NBS which consist of newly constructed ecosystems. We show that inspired NBS in particular will increase opportunities to achieve sustainable development in food systems. NBS can facilitate the much-needed transition to a different way of using our natural resources to reach the SDGs by 2030. We identify the knowledge gaps that impede the development of NBS to support a transition towards sustainable, climate-resilient food systems.

TI  - Setting-up place-based and transdisciplinary research to foster agrifood system transformation: Insights from the Aliment'Actions project in western France
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many agrifood systems around the world can be characterized as unsustainable. Research is increasingly required to inform the necessary radical transformations of the ways we produce, process, transport, and consume food. This article presents the research approach and methods of an ongoing project carried out at a long-term social-ecological research site, the Zone Atelier Plaine and Val de Sevre (western France). The research project presented here, Aliment'Actions, started in 2018 and within 10 years of its implementation seeks to study and trigger transformation to enhance the sustainability and resilience of the regional agrifood system. Its research agenda contains four types of actions: (a) backdrop actions that enhance communication and trust between researchers and local stakeholders, (b) targeted actions that are conducted in specific villages with a wide range of stakeholders to elaborate and implement various transformation levers, (c) assessment actions evaluating the effects of different interventions, and (d) communication and result from dissemination actions. Overall, these actions aim to co-produce knowledge, raise awareness regarding challenges in the food system, envision new interactions between stakeholders, collectively generate innovative ideas, and catalyze actions oriented toward agrifood system transformation. The project implementation is adaptive and iterative, from theory to practice. This Methods paper puts this ongoing project into the perspective of other place-based research initiatives and provides insights on how to foster the engagement of non-academic actors in transdisciplinary research supporting agrifood system transformation.

TI  - Shall we dance? How systemic intermediaries coordinate interaction within local sustainability initiatives over time
T2  - CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Local sustainability transition projects are often coordinated by systemic intermediaries. In this context, previous research identified an extensive list of systemic intermediary roles and functions in the acceleration phase of these initiatives. However, little is known about the interplay between systemic intermediary activities and emerging collaboration patterns over time. This paper analyses the innovation journeys of six case studies to explore interaction dynamics and collaboration activities that emerge between systemic intermediaries, niche and regime actors over the course of time. Based on this, it develops a conceptual framework that visualizes design patterns that underlie a certain choreography of the systemic intermediaries and complements earlier research with in-depth insights into temporal aspects of multiple-actor mobilization and coordination processes in sustainability transition initiatives.

TI  - How can research on past urban adaptations be made useful for sustainability science?
T2  - GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-technical summaryCities in the distant past - as documented by archaeologists and historians - provide an extensive record of urban successes and failures, yet this information has had little impact on the field of sustainability science. I explore two reasons for this situation. First, these scholars have often failed to synthesize their data scientifically, and, second, they have not approached the transfer of past knowledge to present research in a rigorous manner. I organize discussion of these issues around three arguments for the present value of past cities: the urban trajectory argument, the sample size argument, and the laboratory argument. Technical summaryI explore the different ways historical and archaeological data can be deployed to contribute to research on urban sustainability science, emphasizing issues of argumentation and epistemology. I organize the discussion around three types of argument. The urban trajectory argument exploits the long time series of early cities and urban regions to examine change at a long time scale. The sample size argument views the role of early cities as adding to the known sample of settlements to increase understanding of urban similarities and differences. The laboratory argument uses data from past cities to explicitly test models derived from contemporary cities. Each argument is examined for three contrasting epistemological approaches: heuristic analogs, case studies, and quantitative studies. These approaches form a continuum leading from lesser to greater scientific rigor and from qualitative to quantitative frameworks. Much past-to-present argumentation requires inductive logic, also called reasoning by analogy. Sustainability scientists have confused this general form of argument with its weakest version, known as heuristic analogs. I stress ways to improve methods of argumentation, particularly by moving research along the continuum from weaker to stronger arguments. Social media summaryBetter methods of argument allow the past record of urban success and failure to contribute to urban sustainability science.

TI  - Missions as boundary objects for transformative change: understanding coordination across policy, research, and stakeholder communities
T2  - SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Recent times have seen the rediscovery and adaptation of mission-oriented innovation policies (MIPs) for driving transformative change. While such policies seek to mobilise and align stakeholders, little is known about how missions feature in policy coordination processes. We argue that to facilitate the still troublesome operationalisation of MIPs, it is essential to understand missions as 'boundary objects' that have some shared meanings among the participants they convene, yet are open enough to be interpreted differently by distinct actors gathering in four interconnected policy arenas-i.e. a strategic, programmatic, implementation, and performance arena. By studying the European Commission's Horizon Europe missions, we unravel how missions as boundary objects enable and disable the coordination of heterogeneous communities. The resulting analytical perspective highlights three key mechanisms for coordinating mission meanings across communities and arenas: convergence-divergence, passage, and reflexive learning. We conclude with research avenues for studying missions as boundary objects for facilitating concerted action.

TI  - Evolving conceptions of silvopasture among farmers and natural resource professionals in Wisconsin, USA
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Silvopasture has gained attention as an agroecological practice that may simultaneously meet farmer goals and provide environmental benefits, including climate change mitigation. At the same time there are significant concerns about the potential for livestock to damage trees and forest soils. Like other innovative agroecological systems, silvopasture combines management complexity with limited research knowledge. Unlike annual crops, the effects of silvopasture management can take decades to assess and require forestry as well as agronomic expertise. We conducted mixed-methods research on silvopasture attitudes and knowledge among farmers, agricultural advisors, and foresters in Wisconsin between 2014 and 2019. We asked: (1) How do farmers who practice grazing, agricultural advisors, and foresters perceive silvopasture? and (2) How did coverage of silvopasture change between 2009 and 2019 in a popular grazing publication? Perceptions of silvopasture were influenced by recent weather history, markets for forest and agricultural products, existing land uses, and other contextual factors. Some farmers and agricultural advisors were committed to silvopasture despite significant obstacles to implementing the practice. Over the course of the study period agricultural advisors increased their willingness to provide silvopasture advice to farmers and professional colleagues, and coverage of silvopasture increased in a popular grazing publication. Finally, a multi-county supportive community of practice was associated with greater enthusiasm for the practice. The greater acceptance of silvopasture among resource professionals follows an increase in silvopasture research and outreach in the region. This interest in silvopasture suggests both a need for, and openness to, greater collaboration among forestry and agricultural professionals and farmers to develop sustainable silvopasture standards.

TI  - FiNCO farms for knowledge exchange: A Colombian seed for a good Anthropocene
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Returning to Earth's safe operating space requires driving social-ecological transformations toward a new human-nature configuration, while navigating changes and creatively dealing with crises. Family farms in the Colombian Andes have been navigating changes by using modalities of integrated management that recognize family interdependence with nature, which illustrates social-ecological resilience on a small scale. We potentiated family farming by creating FiNCO (Farms for knowledge exchange) as a strategy that renews the connection between disciplines, academia and farmers, and the rural and urban sectors, in order to promote knowledge co-production and landscape stewardship. In this sense, FiNCO is considered as a seed for a good Anthropocene. This paper is an invitation to plant FiNCO seeds in different social-ecological contexts and to share those experiences as an ideal way to create abilities to transform the upcoming humanity challenges into opportunities for humanity's needed transformation.

TI  - Transitions through the dynamics of adaptive cycles: Evolution of the Finnish agrifood system
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - CONTEXT: The escalating sustainability problems of the current agrifood regime call for a radical, systemic transformation. Such a transformation implies a move into a new stability domain, defined by a new set of systemic attractors. These transformations can be conceptualised as regime shifts. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we explored the history of the Finnish agrifood system in order to learn from the past transformations of the system and to inform the current attempts to steer its development in a more sustainable direction. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative analysis on literature discussing the history of the Finnish agrifood system by utilising the concept of the adaptive cycle, which captures the cyclicity of the evolution of socialecological systems. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We identified six regimes from the 14th century onwards: Expansion (1334-1721), Progressive (1722-1868), Cattle (1869-1918), Premodern (1919-1944), Modernisation (1945-1994) and Globalisation (1995-). During each regime, the evolution of the system organised around specific attractors which initially opened up new possibilities for the actors, but over time, the very same attractors became the main source of vulnerability in the system. Along with the system's maturation, pathdependency created rigidity, escalating sustainability problems and decreasing room for manoeuvre for the system's actors, concomitantly decreasing the system's resilience. When an external shock related to climatic conditions, economic turbulence or wars coincided with such a rigidity, the system collapsed, the consequences of which span from food shortages to large-scale, deadly famines. The collapse of the old regime opened up the window of opportunity for a regime shift. The most profound regime shifts were related to changes in the sys-tem's metabolism and trade orientation. SIGNIFICANCE: While the conservation phase of the adaptive cycle increases systemic vulnerabilities, it also offers an opportunity for systemic transformation. Allowing the adaptive cycle to play out on smaller sca-les-such as at the level of farm systems-helps to avoid collapse on the scale of the whole food system. The current agrifood regime in Finland indicates strong path-dependency and rigidity, manifesting a conservation phase, to be followed by release and reorganisation. This observation calls, first, for considering the resilience of the current system to anticipate a crisis and, second, for outlining alternative visions for the sustainable future of the agrifood system.

TI  - A Social Sciences and Humanities research agenda for transport and mobility in Europe: key themes and 100 research questions
T2  - TRANSPORT REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Transport and mobility systems need to be transformed to meet climate change goals and reduce negative environmental and social effects. Despite EU policies having targeted such problems for more than three decades, transitions have been slow and geographically uneven. For effective change to happen, transport and mobility research needs fresh perspectives and better integration of knowledge from the Social Sciences and Humanities. Based on a Horizon Scanning approach, which allowed for a great deal of openness and variety in scholarly viewpoints, this paper presents a novel research agenda consisting of 8 themes and 100 research questions that may contribute to achieving environmentally sustainable mobility transitions within Europe. This research agenda highlights the need to not only support technological solutions for low-carbon mobility, but the importance of transformative policies that include new processes of knowledge production, civic participation and epistemic justice. We contend that the agenda points to the need for further research on the dynamics of science-society interactions.

TI  - Exploring the practice of Labs for sustainable transformation: The challenge of 'creating impact'
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Scholars have argued that transdisciplinary experimentation processes in Labs which include societal stakeholders in research and innovation might help to create meaningful societal impact. At the same time, there is ample room to explore the practice of 'doing' Labs in relation to the transformative impacts that Labs aim to create. We present a case study of the FIT4FOOD2030 project (2017-2020) aimed at contributing to food system transformation in the EU through setting up 25 multi-stakeholder Labs. We aimed to gain insight into how transdisciplinary Labs with transformative ambitions try to create impact, and which challenges that brings along. For "capacitating change", Labs built agency by focusing on creating (1) new relations through network mobilization, network consolidation and network coordination; (2) new knowledge through knowledge sharing and social learning; and (3) new competences for Lab coordinators and engaged stakeholders. For "creating change" Labs focused on (1) transforming networks - the Lab as catalyst; (2) transforming practices - the Lab as concretizer; (3) transforming structures - the Lab as construction site; (4) transforming cultures - the Lab as critical mass. We observed complex (reciprocal) relations between processes of capacitating and creating change. Finally, we present intrinsic challenges in the practice of 'doing' Labs regarding the evaluation of single-Lab impacts, and the political dynamics of transformative Labs.

TI  - Degrowth and agri-food systems: a research agenda for the critical social sciences
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Degrowth has become a recognised paradigm for identifying and critiquing systemic unsustainability rooted in the capitalist, growth-compelled economy. Increasingly, degrowth is discussed in relation to specific economic sectors such as the agri-food system. This paper builds on the foundational work of Gerber (2020) and Nelson and Edwards (2021). While both publications take a rather specific analytical or disciplinary focus-the former specifically connects critical agrarian studies and degrowth, the latter explores the contributions of the recent volume 'Food for degrowth'-this paper takes stock of the emerging body of literature on degrowth and agri-food systems more broadly. It proposes research avenues that deepen, expand and diversify degrowth research on agri-food systems in four areas: (i) degrowth conceptualisations; (ii) theorisation of transformations towards sustainability; (iii) the political economy of degrowth agri-food systems; and (iv) rurality and degrowth. Together, these avenues devote due attention to a variety of agents (ranging from translocal networks to non-humans), spaces (e.g. the rural), theories (e.g. sustainability transitions and transformations towards sustainability) and policies (of the agricultural sector and beyond) that thus far have received limited attention within the degrowth literature. The critical social science perspective on degrowth agri-food systems, which is advanced in this paper, illuminates that the present unsustainability and injustice of hegemonic agri-food systems are not merely a problem of that sector alone, but rather are ingrained in the social imaginaries of how economies and societies should work as well as in the political-economic structures that uphold and reproduce these imaginaries.

TI  - Intermediating sustainable finance: a case study of The Aotearoa Circle's Sustainable Finance Forum
T2  - POLICY STUDIES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Sustainable Finance Roadmaps (SFRs) have emerged internationally as an instrument for sustainable finance reform. However, there is variation among countries over who leads the SFR process. This article focuses on Aotearoa New Zealand where the process was led by an intermediary, the Sustainable Finance Forum, a multistakeholder process which convened stakeholders for SFR development. This case study contributes to the literature on intermediaries in sustainability transitions by showing intermediation in the financial sector. Empirical analysis demonstrates that intermediation functioned as a strategic intervention to overcome regime-level barriers to transition by visioning, convening and coordinating stakeholders, and developing transition pathways, albeit with challenges in terms of Maori representation and government participation. This case study shows how intermediaries adapted to the distinctive demands of early transition phases, especially by a process of reproduction where one intermediary created another.

TI  - Adaptive Water Management: On the Need for Using the Post-WWII Science in Water Governance
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the UN concluded, already in 1997, that water would be the most contentious issue of the 21st century, water governance is still confused, nearly everywhere. Even the severe impacts of escalating water bankruptcy and global warming have so far failed to incur a marked improvement in governance systems. The global community has adopted sustainable development as a common vision and guide for the future. Yet, the adoption of the underlying principles of sustainable development has been slow in the water sector and elsewhere. Despite the realization that water governance is a political issue, the near-universal neoliberal agenda tends to only employ technologic and economic solutions to address water problems. This paper presents a historical overview, from the end of the Second World War (WWII) and onwards, of events that could, or should, have had an impact on water management frameworks. It evidences some important consequences of the institutional rigidity exposed during that period. The paper also turns to the fields of science, policy, and management, to pinpoint failures in the translation of political rhetoric as well as new scientific findings into change at the operational level. It explores how an updated knowledge base could serve a quest for sustainable water governance strategies. It is argued that a persistent failure to learn is an important reason behind the dire state that we are now in. As a result, water management is still based on century-old, technocratic, and instrumental methodologies that fail to take advantage of important scientific advancements since WWII and remain unable to properly deal with real-world complexities and uncertainties. The paper concludes that when it is linked to a transformation of the institutional superstructure, adaptive water management (AWM), a framework rooted in systems thinking, emerges as a prominent way to embark on a needed, radical transformation of the water governance systems.

TI  - Transformation as system innovation: insights from Nepal's five decades of community forestry development
T2  - INNOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies of sustainability transitions and transformational change are common in energy and transport sectors. However, there is limited research on how these transformational change processes play out in the natural resources sector, particularly in developing economies. This paper seeks to address this gap, with a case study of the community forestry system in Nepal that has, over the last four decades, reversed Himalayan land degradation and contributed to community livelihoods. The case illustrates comprehensive changes in forest management practices and governance over four decades. Central to this was a 'thinking movement' of development agencies, activists and researchers that opened up learning spaces and engage conflicting stakeholders in action-oriented dialogues. While transformation can never be pre-engineered, this study suggests that investment in strengthening locally engaged research capability could be a key way of catalyzing sustainability transitions, both as a continuous process of evolution and transformative shifts during the crisis and political opportunity.

TI  - Ecological Civilization and High-Quality Development: Do Tourism Industry and Technological Progress Affect Ecological Economy Development?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The tourism industry is considered a smokeless industry or green economy. Under the circumstances of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, it is essential and urgent to explore whether the tourism industry and technological progress can promote ecological economy development. Based on the panel data of 30 provinces in mainland China from 2007-2019, this paper, for the first time, incorporates the tourism industry, technological progress, and ecological economy development into the analytical framework by constructing a PVAR model. In addition, this paper calculates the indicator weights of each variable using the entropy weighting method. This paper utilizes GMM tests, impulse response analysis, Monte Carlo simulation, and variance decomposition to empirically investigate the dynamic impact mechanism of variables interacting with each other. The conclusions are as follows. First, the tourism industry always contributes positively to ecological economy development, while technological progress can facilitate ecological economy development in the long run rather than in the short term. Second, the tourism industry also positively contributes to technological progress. Third, ecological economy development has a "crowding out effect" on the tourism industry. Fourth, the tourism industry in developed eastern regions has a more powerful impact on ecological economy development than in underdeveloped middle and western regions. Based on the empirical results, we provide practical implications: first, the assessment system of the regional economy should include ecological development indicators; second, the tourism industry should accelerate the use of clean energy and the transformation of green technological innovation.

TI  - Engaging with the future: framings of adaptation to climate change in conservation
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Review
AB  - The term 'adaptation' is commonplace in conservation research and practice, but often without a reflection on the assumptions, expectations, or frames of reference used to define goals and actions. Communities of practice (e.g. conservation researchers, protected areas managers) have different interpretations of climate change impacts on biodiversity and different ways of defining, operationalizing and implementing adaptation. Their cognitive and motivational expectations for the future are associated with different paths to reach such desired futures. To understand how adaptation is framed in conservation, we undertook a systematic review with a thematic synthesis of the definitions of the term as used in the academic conservation literature. From a sample of 150 articles, only 36 provided a definition of adaptation. We critically appraised the explicit definitions to identify emergent themes that represent particular adaptation approaches. Themes were then grouped, and each group was assigned to a scholarly tradition, onto-epistemological approach and theoretical perspective. Based on theoretical perspectives on social change, we propose a framework (including individual cognitive basis, social interactions, and openness to alternatives) to analyse how change is framed in the definitions and how the framings influence adaptation options. The grouped themes represent passive, active, or indirect adaptation approaches. We used these themes to generate a conceptual model to guide conservation researchers and practitioners engaged in climate adaptation research, policy and management to aid reflection and understanding of the options available to design adaptation agendas and allow negotiation of diverse interests, views and expectations about the future.

TI  - Gender in sustainability transition studies: Concepts, blind spots and future orientations
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Gender is a vital factor of societal organisation and transformation, and figures prominently in global sustainability agendas. Its social construction and interaction with technological change have been studied extensively. Within the field of sustainability transition (ST) research, however, the complex roles gender plays in socio-technical change are still rarely addressed or con-ceptualised. Based on a systematic review covering scientific publications from 2010 to 2020 we illustrate this overall gap and explore how gender is operationalised. We draw on Harding's notion of gender as structural, symbolic and behavioural expression to consider implications for understanding regimes, niches, and regime/niche interactions. Our results recognise a variety of conceptual approaches accounting for the diverse implications of gender relations for transition dynamics and their sustainability orientation. In conclusion we recognise the usefulness of the suggested analytical lens for strengthening gender-sensitive inter-and transdisciplinary ST research systematically, and suggest promising avenues for future studies.

TI  - Energizing a transformation to a circular bioeconomy: mechanisms to spread, deepen and broaden initiatives
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Transformative change is necessary to reach a circular bioeconomy. In this context, a variety of societal and business initiatives have emerged, which in their everyday practices aim to increase their circular impact. These emerging circular initiatives, so-called small wins, continuously spread, deepen and broaden and as such contribute to transformative change. A small win spreads by becoming larger and more numerous, deepens by becoming more radical and circular, and broadens by connecting with other themes and domains. This paper explores how mechanisms drive these processes and, more in particular, how circular initiatives stay or become more transformative while developing. By building on existing literature about mechanisms that contribute to the development of initiatives-we extend the small wins framework by focusing on the interplay between mechanisms and spreading, deepening and broadening. We applied this framework to two illustrative cases in the Netherlands: a circular laying hen farm, Kipster, and the community farming initiative, Herenboeren. We empirically explored how the interplay of mechanisms constitutes continuous transformative change. The results indicate that deepening the small win is mainly driven by learning by doing; spreading takes place through professionalization and broadening by partnering. Both case studies indicate that the energizing and logic of attraction mechanisms are key in continuous transformative change.

T2  - PLANNING PRACTICE AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This article reports on an attempt to implement regional design in a decarbonization transition in Lusatia, one of Germany's lignite regions. As visioning tools, regional designs have great potential for application in coal-regions facing sustainability transitions. Through the implementation of the Lusatia 2050 Planning Lab, we find that the politically induced nature of the present transition, combined with regional factors, such its cross-border character and scepticism regarding sustainability, significantly modified the design and outcome of the method as applied. We note that the resistance to transformative goals by powerful actors administering transitions may prove an important impediment to their success.

TI  - Disrupting the status quo: a sustainability transitions analysis of the fashion system
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY-SCIENCE PRACTICE AND POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The fashion industry has developed into a complex global system with persistent social and environmental sustainability challenges. Private, public, and civil society actors have condemned these persistent problems and called for system change toward sustainable fashion. While alternative practices and industry collaborations have emerged throughout the system, they have not added up to a sustainability transition. Instead, the system shows signs of being locked into unsustainability. The aim of this article is to examine the state of transition of the fashion industry through a multi-level perspective system analysis, based on a co-creative research project with the former C&A Foundation, which became the Laudes Foundation in 2020. This transition analysis shows that the fashion system is locked into a state of disconnection, uncontrollability, extraction, growth-focus, and disposability. We build from analysis and present a set of strategic transition pathways that can be pursued today throughout the fashion system to accelerate the transition to sustainable fashion.

TI  - Accelerating sustainability transitions: the case of the hydrogen agenda in the North West region of England
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY-SCIENCE PRACTICE AND POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Low-carbon hydrogen can assist in addressing the global crisis of climate change by significantly decarbonizing a range of heavy-emitting sectors. In the United Kingdom, hydrogen technologies are at the forefront of the net zero-emission roadmaps of many industrial clusters. However, with impending timeframes linked to emission targets and other decarbonization objectives, it is increasingly important to understand how to accelerate such transitions to hydrogen. There is, to date, a notable gap in the academic literature concerning the acceleration of sustainability transitions. Using the case of the hydrogen agenda in England's North West region, we explore how the transition to hydrogen can be accelerated and thus begin to contribute toward filling this omission. In doing so, we use data collected through semi-structured interviews and from the public domain to unpack and develop upon an existing framework that emerged from the European Commission funded-project Accelerating and Rescaling Transitions to Sustainability (ARTS). The framework comprises five acceleration mechanisms which local sustainability transition initiatives have adopted. This analysis generates novel findings in relation to why actors in the region have faced difficulties in instrumentalizing as well as the mechanism's overall importance in acceleration. We use these challenges to inform several recommendations which policy makers could adopt to accelerate the North West's, and wider UK's, transition to hydrogen.

TI  - Creating actionable knowledge one step at a time: An analytical framework for tracing systems and agency in niche innovation pathways
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a practice-oriented analytical framework that supports the generation of actionable knowledge for practice and policy actors to facilitate sustainable niche innovations to emerge and mature. Originating from an applied research context, the framework combines and operation-alises existing transition-related concepts and frameworks to build on their respective strengths and make them more relevant for practice. The framework facilitates tracing the development pathways of niche innovations from system-centred and agency-centred perspectives to yield in-sights into both the complex dynamics of innovation processes and the options for actions by different actors. We apply the framework to three cases of innovative coupled infrastructures in Germany and reflect on the extent to which these gauged actionable knowledge. Far from being a silver bullet to realising transformative change, making theoretical frameworks applicable to practice, and applying them in collaborative ways is nevertheless an important step when aiming to generate actionable knowledge for sustainability transitions.

TI  - Lewin?s field theory as a lens for understanding incumbent actors? agency in sustainability transitions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding incumbent actors' behavior is one of the current key targets in sustainability transitions research. Scholars studying incumbents' agency have demanded the inclusion of broader social-science theories that bridge different levels (i.e., individual, group) and enable the inclusion of a multitude of actors' drivers and motives into one coherent framework. The present article suggests that Kurt Lewin's field theory, an influential theory of social and organizational change, may be suited for this purpose. From the perspective of field theory, actors are exposed to various partially conflicting 'field forces' (e.g., related to needs, expectations, or roles). The relative strength of these forces determines actors' decisions and behavior. The paper introduces key concepts of Lewin's field theory and reinterprets incumbents' responses to sustainability transitions from a field-theoretical perspective. It elaborates on potential theoretical and methodical benefits of Lewin's field theory for studying incumbents' agency and closes with a discussion of practical implications.

TI  - Pinning it down? Measuring innovation for sustainability transitions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainability transitions require shifts in multiple social systems, practices, and institutions. Different innovation perspectives are essential for achieving and understanding transitions. They range from actor-oriented (organizational innovation management, regional innovation ecosystems) to mode-oriented (responsible innovation, mission-driven innovation) to process-oriented (social innovation) perspectives. For sustainability transitions to be governed, we need a better understanding of how the relevant contributions of innovations can be measured. In this article, we review the status of measurement across the different innovation perspectives. We find that measurement status becomes weaker as we move from actor-oriented to process-oriented innovations. To address this shortcoming, we then develop a conceptual approach for measuring social innovation. Thereby, we integrate organizational innovation capacities and regional contexts with the transformational elements of social innovation. We discuss how such an integrated and multi-level approach to measurement enhances our understanding of social innovations and, in particular, their contributions to sustainability transitions. We contribute to the sustainability transitions literature by tying it to different innovation perspectives and by conceptualizing new innovation mechanisms that drive transformations. We add to social innovation theory by specifying its role in change toward sustainability and advancing it to a measurable construct relevant to governance and policymaking.

TI  - Sustainability innovations: a proposal for an analytical framework and its empirical application in the Schorfheide-Chorin Biosphere Reserve
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Sustainability innovations influence societal transformations through the development of new products, processes, organizations, behaviors or values. Although various research approaches have tackled technological innovations in the last few decades, the specificities and enabling conditions of individual sustainability innovations remain rather unknown. We therefore propose an analytical framework, built on learning from the social-ecological systems and transitions literature. The sustainability innovation framework features four dimensions: context, actors, process and outcomes, which are detailed in 31 variables. We use the sustainability innovation framework to analyze two case studies selected in the Schorfheide-Chorin Biosphere Reserve, Germany. The first refers to technological and organizational innovation in mobility, while the second relates to social and organizational innovation in agriculture. As a result, we highlight commonalities and differences in enabling conditions and variables between the two cases, which underpin the influence of trust, commitment, resource availability, experimenting, learning, advocating, and cooperating for innovation development. The cases further demonstrate that sustainability innovations develop as bundles of interdependent, entangled novelties, due to their disruptive character. Their specificity thereby resides in positive outcomes in terms of social-ecological integrity and equity. This study therefore contributes to transitions studies via a detailed characterization of sustainability innovations and of their outcomes, as well as through a generic synthesis of variables into an analytical framework that is applicable to a large and diverse range of individual sustainability innovations. Further empirical studies should test these findings in other contexts, to pinpoint generic innovation development patterns and to develop a typology of sustainability innovation archetypes.

TI  - Towards a deeper understanding of up-scaling in socio-technical transitions: The case of energy communities
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The pressing nature of the climate crisis is placing sub-national action at the forefront of climate mitigation. Energy communities have been an example of such niche action, as, over the past decades, they have blossomed in number and have challenged dominant narratives of the energy transition. The aggregate impact such action promises may be necessary to mitigate the global-scale problem of the climate crisis. This opens up the vexing question of what mechanisms are at play in scaling such action and how the contours of causality may be painted in the pathways towards transitions. This article aims to address this gap by building on the concept of mechanismic thinking. The innovative nature of this approach helps us identify empirical examples of conditions of scaling and brings conceptual clarity to studying processes of transitions. This article identifies conditions in relation to various pathways of transitions and the strategic management of niches. We identify several conditions that scaling may depend on through a systematic literature review of the energy community literature. From our review, two key results surface: Firstly, at the empirical level, the conditions identified suggest that a diversity of pathways to scaling may exist in parallel. Secondly, the conditions found in the literature can productively be mapped based on three dimensions: conditions internal to communities, conditions affecting interactions between communities, and finally, conditions related to the context of community initiatives. By feeding back our findings into leading theories in the field, our review enriches existing accounts of niche-internal dynamics of the strategic niche management approach. Moreover, we suggest that mechanismic thinking has much to add to the research agenda on connecting local scale innovation and higher scale impact in socio-technical thinking.

TI  - Circular economy policies and their transformative outcomes: The transformative intent of Finland's strategic policy programme
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyses how Finland's circular economy policy attends not only to the promotion and acceleration of innovation, but also the reconfiguration of resource intensive systems. Socio-technical transitions research has historically focused on niche innovation processes. Yet recently, increasing attention has been placed on policy processes that seek to destabilise and disrupt incumbent systems and practices. Furthermore, the social justice aspects of system phase out policies have been brought to the fore. Our qualitative analysis of Finland's circular economy policy programme draws upon the transformative innovation policy and sustainability transitions policy-mix literatures, extending the transformative outcome framework to include outcomes related to the repercussions of regime destabilisation, coordination and tilting the socio-technical landscape. Our analysis shows that Finland's circular economy policy programme aims predominantly at niche stimulation and acceleration, with little emphasis on the regime destabilisation or coordination. Overall, the policy proposals aim toward a strategy of progressive system change, an orientation shaped by the country's corporatist approach to policy making and pre-existing plans.

TI  - Adoption of Sustainable Agriculture Practices through Participatory Research: A Case Study on Galapagos Islands Farmers Using Water-Saving Technologies
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture in the populated islands of the Galapagos Archipelago, a protected area due to its unique biodiversity, has been detrimental to its conservation but highly required to meet food necessities. A potential solution to make agricultural farming more sustainable is adopting water-saving technologies (WSTs). Therefore, this study aimed to test the effectiveness of using WSTs such as Groasis Waterboxx (R) in three of the most valuable crops in the islands through participatory research with the involvement of a group of farmers from the Floreana and Santa Cruz islands and explore a possible transition to more sustainable agricultural practices. Capsicum annuum, Cucumis sativus and Solanum lycopersicum were cultivated using Groasis Waterboxx (R) and compared to conventional irrigation practices (drip-irrigated controls) to assess the variability of productivity, the number of fruits and individual fruit weight (IFW). In addition, differences in plant traits were analyzed by crop, and island. Results suggested that WSTs such as Groasis Waterboxx (R) may provide on-farm benefits regarding the yields of the studied traits. From this study, it is difficult to determine whether participation in such a research study will permanently change irrigation practices. However, the participant's responses to the study suggest an increase in their understanding of the use and benefits of WST.

TI  - FoodLink-A Network for Driving Food Transition in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The territory that currently corresponds to the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (LMA) has historically supplied fresh food to the urban population until half way through the 20th century. In 2018, the land use was still composed 38% of agricultural area, supplying 12% of the total food produced and consumed in Portugal. However, the operation of this food system is not subject to any regulations either in terms of spatial planning or land use management and, as such, its impact on sustainability transition in the region is not yet properly known. How to drive food transition in the LMA has thus arisen as a prominent question. In 2019, within a living lab context, the first steps were taken to this very challenging pathway, in which the definition of a food strategy was identified as the priority to sow the seeds of a food planning process. Over the last three years a food network started to operate on a collaborative basis to co-define a set of long-term objectives, a vision for 2030 and a collaborative biannual action plan. This article describes the process on how FoodLink-Network for the Food Transition in the LMA-leveraged the foundations to set up an evidence-based food strategy in the metropolitan area and how its thirty members became committed to cooperating in a science-policy-practice interface for its elaboration. According to principles of action-research and citizen science that implied a direct observation and involvement of the author along the entire process, the results intend to respond to the three objectives of the research by: (i) contributing to the literature on food networks; (ii) describing how the networking process occurred and its main achievements in what concerns a committed action plan; (iii) presenting the first baseline to pursue a food strategy towards the food planning of the city-region. It is understood that these results on how the food transition process is being driven in the LMA may either be inspiring for the construction of similar initiatives in other city regions, within and outside Europe, or may constitute the referential starting point for the future assessment of this ongoing transdisciplinary process.

TI  - Postgraduate Trends in the Training of Human Talent for Sustainable Development
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - A sustainable university must educate its academic collaborators and its interest groups, focusing on the key dimensions, such as economic growth, respect for the environment and carrying out energy saving measures, and efficiency and reuse of resources. The aim of this research is to show the tendencies of postgraduate courses in the training of human talent for "Sustainable Development" based on grounded theory. The methodology is approached from the qualitative naturalistic perspective, where the hermeneutic analysis procedure is structured in five phases with data from nine countries obtained from 20 interviews conducted in the year 2021. For this, a dialogical intervention has been used through the complementary experiences of rectors, deans and specialists with doctoral degrees who are immersed in postgraduate programmes in Latin American and Spanish universities, safeguarding the identity under ethical criteria. The main findings show that this human capital that forms part of the universities through their postgraduate programmes is currently considering redesigning their educational programmes to contribute to sustainable development, not only academically but also through their educational model. The main evidence shows that today more than ever there is a need for change, a need for a new human resource that responds and aims for a triple balance: environmental, economic and social.

TI  - An index to measure the sustainability of place-based development pathways
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main goals of modern sustainability science is to generate knowledge that societies can use to move toward more sustainable development pathways; however, there are few quantitative methods available to assess such pathways. This paper proposes a new index (the Sustainable Development Pathway Index, SDPI) that uses the Euclidean norm to measure the distance between the ideal and the actual development pathways of any geopolitical unit in a determined time frame. We test the new index by evaluating the development pathways of the 517 municipalities of the Brazilian Amazon, one of the world's last economic frontiers, from 1991 to 2010, by simultaneously analyzing indicators of ecological and socioeconomic infrastructures. We show that the region can be described as a mosaic of geopolitical units following distinct development pathways in response to the economic activities and extensive land transformations advancing from the region's southern and eastern borders to its center. This general pattern aligns well with the region's recent history. We outline a research agenda for using the SDPI to document the broad patterns of development pathways and the processes that make them sustainable or unsustainable.

TI  - Visualization analysis of research on climate innovation on CiteSpace
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has brought great challenges to global sustainability, but only few research achievements in innovation for climate change mitigation and adaptation have been reported. This study aims to identify the current research status and trends in climate innovation via CiteSpace visual analysis. We searched for published papers (up to 2021) in the core repository of Web of Science by using the theme of innovation for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Using the collected articles, we conducted co-authorship analysis, co-citation analysis, and keyword co-occurrence analysis and found that the main contributors are from America, England, and China. Moreover, climate innovation has an interdisciplinary knowledge source, and its main research frontier focuses on the design of policies for energy efficiency improvement and new energy technologies. These results point out some directions for further research on climate innovation and outline the knowledge structure in this field, thereby addressing the lack of studies on such topic. By analyzing the lineage of research developments, it is found that energy technology and energy efficiency would be the main research hotspots in climate innovation in the future, and relevant policies also need to strengthen incentives for research in this area. This study is particularly helpful for those researchers who are interested in climate innovation and can subsequently contribute to the long-term development of various research directions in this field, to the formulation of climate change mitigation and adaptation policies, and to the sustainable development of human society.

TI  - Understanding deforestation lock-in: Insights from Land Reform settlements in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cropland and pasture expansion continues to erase natural ecosystems at a staggering speed globally, notably in the tropics. Conventional policy approaches, usually focused on a particular land-use change driver (e.g., specific commodities) or individual regulations (e.g., the Amazon Soy Moratorium), have consistently failed to achieve sufficient or sustained results. The swift reversal of Brazil's earlier success in reducing Amazon deforestation - now again accelerated - offers perhaps the most sobering illustration of that. Therefore, this article draws from scholarship on sustainability transitions to propose a more comprehensive systems view of unsustainable land-use patterns. We examine persistent tropical deforestation as a case of "lock-in," using a transitions lens, and explore its constitutive elements. As a case study, we analyze the situation of Land Reform settlements in the Brazilian Amazon, where as much as one-third of that biome's deforestation takes place. While subject to some specific factors, those places are also enmeshed in a broader setting that is common across the Brazilian Amazon's deforestation frontier (e.g., infrastructure conditions, market demands, and sociocultural norms). Drawing from document analysis of Brazilian policies and fieldwork in three Land Reform settlements in Para State, we expose multiple forms of techno-economic, institutional, and socio-cognitive lock-in that together drive deforestation systemically in those settlements. These drivers form a strongly consolidated socio-technical regime around large-scale agriculture that includes material and immaterial factors (e.g., cultural ones), a regime that not only resists change but also - like a vortex - pulls others into it. Escaping deforestation lock-in may thus require outside forces to help local actors destabilize and eventually replace this unsustainable land-use regime. International zero-deforestation efforts offer a starting point, but a transition requires moving beyond piecemeal, incremental change or end-of-pipe approaches and toward concerted, strategic action that addresses multiple of those regime elements in a coordinated way to replace it as a system. We argue that understanding deforestation lock-in is vital for tackling its worrisome persistence and that sustainability transitions theory offers an illuminating, but still underutilized, framework to analyze and eventually overcome unsustainable land use.

TI  - Food systems transformations in South America: Insights from a transdisciplinary process rooted in Uruguay
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The wicked nature of sustainability challenges facing food systems demands intentional and synergistic actions at multiple scales and sectors. The Southern Cone of Latin America, with its historical legacy of "feeding the world," presents interesting opportunities for generating insights into potential trajectories and processes for food system transformation. To foster such changes would require the development of collective understanding and agency to effectively realize purposeful and well-informed action toward desirable and sustainable food futures. This in turn demands the transdisciplinary engagement of academia, the private sector, government/policy-makers, community groups, and other institutions, as well as the broader society as food consumers. While the need for contextualized knowledge, priorities and definitions of what sustainable food systems change means is recognized, there is limited literature reporting these differences and critically reflecting on the role of knowledge brokers in knowledge co-production processes. The political nature of these issues requires arenas for dialogue and learning that are cross-sectoral and transcend knowledge generation. This paper presents a case study developed by SARAS Institute, a bridging organization based in Uruguay. This international community of practice co-designed a 3-year multi-stakeholder transdisciplinary process entitled "Knowledges on the Table." We describe how the process was designed, structured, and facilitated around three phases, two analytical levels and through principles of knowledge co-production. The case study and its insights offer a model that could be useful to inform similar processes led by transdisciplinary communities of practice or bridging institutions in the early stages of transformative work. In itself, it also represents a unique approach to generate a language of collaboration, dialogue, and imagination informed by design skills and methods. While this is part of a longer-term process toward capitalizing on still-unfolding insights and coalitions, we hope that this example helps inspire similar initiatives to imagine, support, and realize contextualized sustainable food system transformations.

TI  - COVID-19 and the malaria elimination agenda in Africa: Re-shifting the focus
T2  - GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The global Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in public health, political, scientific and private sector response at an unprecedented scale. However, this shift in focus has caused widespread disruption to global health services and has the potential to reverse gains made in efforts to control malaria. If health systems are not able to maintain malaria control interventions while managing the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, malaria cases will increase, thereby placing even more strain on already overtaxed systems. Using a Narrative Review Approach, this commentary explores the impact of COVID-19 on progress made with malaria control and prevention strategies in Africa; and discusses possible mitigation steps to aid community resilience building, through proactive planning and implementation of integrated, inclusive and sustainable strategies to re-shift the focus to attain the malaria elimination goals. We propose strengthening community partnerships, where academia and communities should collaborate and these knowledge-sharing strategies be implemented in order for awareness and interventions to become more networked, inclusive, resilient and effective. Communities should be viewed as 'thought partners', who challenge conventional strategies and aid in developing innovative approaches to community resilience building.

TI  - Towards Sustainable Urban Food Systems: Potentials, Impacts and Challenges of Grassroots Initiatives in the Foodshed of Muenster, Germany
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Solving fundamental sustainability challenges in our food systems requires political, institutional and socio-technical transformations. Indeed, sustainability transitions are needed. In this paper, we explore the role of civil society in the form of bottom-up grassroots initiatives in the transition towards a sustainable urban food system and examine their potentials, impacts and challenges in the foodshed of Munster in Germany. To this end, relevant initiatives in Munster have been researched and mapped according to explicit criteria, and case studies have been compiled for two of them using questionnaires, interviews and desk research: a community-supported agriculture (CSA) farm Entrup 119 and an urban gardening initiative GruneBeete e.V. The results indicate that many initiatives in Munster focus on education and information, i.e., raising awareness, rather than offering material alternatives. Six initiatives were studied in more depth using desk research and a questionnaire. Key leverage points identified by the initiatives are in policy, education, networks and communication. Two of these were studied as cases. We see these transition pioneers as paradigmatic role models, providing room for experimentation, social learning and empowerment.

TI  - Just transitions for industrial decarbonisation: A framework for innovation, participation, and justice
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Here we propose a framework for considering the justice issues of industrial cluster decarbonisation, a pressing challenge confronting many industrialised economies. Industrial clusters are large, multi-point source emitters, users of energy and employers of regional and national significance. In the UK, establishing low carbon industrial clusters is one of several grand challenges of industrial strategy. Theorising the just transition of industrial clusters requires concepts from multiple literatures. We abstract relevant themes from the intersections of the literatures of just transitions, innovation studies and sociotechnical transitions, and public participation in spatial planning, and illustrate their empirical relevance. The broad themes of our framework are (i) politics, space and institutions, with sub-themes of justice, democracy, financialization; (ii) new processes and procedures, with sub -themes of legal recognition of public concerns, community-based planning, community capacity enhancement and life cycle impact assessment; and (iii) correlates of acceptance and resistance, with sub-themes of envi-ronmental values, perceived loss of amenity, pre-existing politics, perceptions of just process and trust in the developer. The framework is intended to both guide the design of just transition processes ex-ante and evaluate these post-hoc.

TI  - Achieving social-ecological fit in projectified environmental governance: Exploring vertical and horizontal dimensions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Social-ecological fit has been a popular approach to assessing the connectedness between social and ecological systems in environmental governance. However, the role of projects in social-ecological fit has yet to be explicitly problematized and conceptualized. Given the centrality of projects - i.e. temporally limited organizations that bring various actors into collaboration to pursue clearly defined goals and tasks - in environmental governance, this is a serious shortcoming in the literature. In this paper, we fill this gap by drawing on the hitherto unconnected literatures on projectified environmental governance and social-ecological fit. We then assess the extent to which fit can be achieved in projectified environmental governance. To do this, we develop a novel framework for assessing the vertical and horizontal dimensions of social, spatial, and temporal fit and conduct an empirical study of the European Union's LIFE Program and environmental projects funded by the program in Estonia. Our results suggest that the spatial and temporal fit of projects is contingent on social fit, i.e., the alignment of interests and needs of project-related actors. Frictions between various levels of decision-making also condition the possibilities of achieving fit horizontally across stakeholder groups and ecological systems as well as of sustaining project results over time.

TI  - Towards water resilience through Nature-based Solutions in the Global South? Scoping the prevailing conditions for Water Sensitive Design in Cape Town and Johannesburg
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water Sensitive Design (WSD) is gaining attention as a Nature-based Solution (NbS) to urban water problems. It incorporates green infrastructure with engineered urban water systems through innovative design of the built environment and urban landscape. In Africa, Johannesburg and Cape Town are two cities engaging with WSD at a policy level. This paper uses the Strategic Niche Management (SNM) approach in a comparative analysis of ongoing engagement with WSD in Johannesburg and Cape Town. We explore the extent to which this engagement signals the launch of the transition towards water resilience. WSD represents a niche that is in synergy with the visions of sustainable urban (water and environmental) management in both cities. Results indicate a progressive engagement with WSD by different actors at regime and niche levels. However, the lack of coordination and capacity deficiencies due to limited social networks and higher order learning are challenges that constrain take-off and further consolidation of the WSD approach in the transition towards water resilient futures. Furthermore, we find urban governance practitioners struggle with reconciling the pursuit of visions of sustainability to be realised through nature-based urban development with the pressing infrastructure deficits that persist in most African cities.

TI  - Alternative places for alternative people? A changing ecovillage discourse from Othered lifestyle to another rurality
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Interest in ecovillages has increased greatly in the last two decades, alongside a growing awareness of the need for more sustainable lifestyles. Once regarded as countercultural, alternative places for alternative people, some ecovillages actively work to gain a more mainstream identity for themselves and sustainable lifestyles. While most research focuses on perspectives within ecovillages, attention to outside representations or discourse is limited. This paper looks to expand knowledge into how ecovillages are represented from the outside through factual media. Analysing printed texts and documentary films, we ask how (rural) sustainable lifestyles are represented through factual media surrounding an ecovillage regarded as Norway's first. Where representations have the power to (re)produce understandings of the world around us, we argue that representations of ecovillages can potentially construct or remove barriers towards engaging with sustainable ways of living. Following the discourse from 2001 to 2019 we find the ecovillage represented as either Idealistic or Entrepreneurial. Processes of Othering juxtapose alternative sustainable lifestyles with an Entrepreneurial sustainable place, creating distance to Idealistic dreams and celebrating commercialism. Additionally, factual media plays a role in constructing understandings of `rural' and `urban' through representing a potentially new discourse of Norwegian rurality, an `eco-idyll' for mainstreaming sustainable lifestyles.

TI  - Locked in unsustainability: Understanding lock-ins and their interactions using the case of food packaging
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lock-in mechanisms are major hurdles to sustainability transitions. Scholars identified various types of lock-ins; however, their dynamics and interactions remain underexplored. Using the case of food packaging, this study enhances the conceptual understanding and empirical analysis of lock-ins and their interactions from a socio-technical perspective. We analyze the material, institutional, behavioral, and discursive configuration and the shallow and deep lock-ins reinforcing the persistent dominance of single-use over reusable food packaging in Germany. Additionally, we explore the lock-in interactions both within and between the socio-technical elements. Hence, we introduce archetypical interlock-ins and lock-in clusters pointing to core trends of resistance towards reusable packaging alternatives. This study advances the lock-in concept for future socio-technical analyses while guiding the illumination of the complex dynamics of stability, the assessment of current sustainability transition interventions, and the search for potential unlocking strategies to enable change.

TI  - Blind Spot for Pioneering Farmers? Reflections on Dutch Dairy Sustainability Transition
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the questions of how to govern the transition towards sustainable farming in a responsible and inclusive manner by exploring the Dutch dairy case. Sustainability transition is about fundamental social-technical changes to address the grand challenges that society faces today. It includes breaking down and phasing out unsustainable practice as well as scaling up sustainable alternatives. Transition literature argues that governments should implement a mix of transition tasks to give direction, support the new and destabilase the unsustainable. In addition, market-based instruments (MBIs) and policy interventions rewarding sustainable farming stimulate transition. This study illustrates that strong and prolonged pressure of not meeting international environmental agreements triggered the implementation of stronger policy interventions that destabilize the unsustainable. However, less policy attention seems to be given to supporting the "new", such as pioneering alternative farmers who develop sustainable alternatives to mainstream farming. To achieve more responsible and inclusive sustainability transitions, it is important to implement tailor-made policies that support pioneering alternative farmers who are already taking steps in developing sustainable farms which, in addition to food, provide ecological and other benefits to community.

TI  - What about citizens? A literature review of citizen engagement in sustainability transitions research
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Public engagement is understood as a prerequisite for sustainability transitions. Yet, it has remained peripheral to the transitions research agenda and the efforts to engage citizens in transitions research remain scattered. Thus, there is a need to create a more holistic understanding of how citizens participate in knowledge co-creation for sustainability transitions. We review the sustainability transitions literature from the perspective of citizen engagement in research and provide an overview of the current situation. Overall, citizen engagement was relatively rare, and the reviewed articles remained only loosely connected to transitions approaches. We identified four key forms of citizen engagement in transitions research: (1) envisioning sustainable futures; (2) local transition implementation; (3) revealing public perceptions; and (4) developing participatory methods to facilitate transitions. These forms facilitate transitions in terms of participant empowerment and providing a broader understanding of practical circumstances. However, citizens rarely participated throughout the research process and the acknowledgement of citizens' local knowledge remained limited. There is a need to deepen citizen engagement in transitions research and more explicitly address power relations. More creative methods can better enable the active contribution of citizens. Finally, there is a need for more theoretical consideration on knowledge co-creation with citizens in sustainability transitions research.

TI  - Expert and Diffuse Design of a Sustainable Circular Economy in Two German Circular Roadmap Projects
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - According to sustainability transitions theory, socio-technical change requires a convergence of politics, social change, technology, and niche innovations. Recently, a circular economy has been proposed as the engine of such change in the EU New Green Deal and Germany. Mainstream circular economy emphasizes the closing of material loops as the way to ensure green growth, and there is a key role for design to achieve such change. According to reports, however, the global appetite for a circular economy remains limited and critics have pointed to several contradictions between the rhetoric and reality of the circular economy and sustainable development. In addition, current formulations of circular economy misrepresent the plurality of discourses for a sustainable circular economy and the role of expert and diffuse circular design. In this study, we employ the recently articulated ten principles for a sustainable circular economy and society to analyze two contrasting circular roadmap projects in Germany, which reflect two contrasting technical and reformist circular discourses, and understandings of the role of design. We find that there are narrow and broad interpretations of design inherent in these circular policies as well as the exemplification of the difference between a technical circular economy and reformist circular society discourses. The practical applied value of this analysis is that the framework can be employed to analyze other policies.

TI  - Diversifying deep transitions: Accounting for socio-economic directionality
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper sets out to enrich the emerging debate on 'deep', transversal transitions. It does so by drawing attention to socio-economic developments neglected in the Deep Transition (DT) framework of Kanger and Schot, such as marketization, labour contracts becoming more individual and precarious, and changing human beliefs, aspirations, needs and wants as important developments. The framework of Deep Transition is criticised for neglecting tensions and contestations about progress, the socio-economic order and distributional issues. This paper aims to complement 'deep transitions' research with insights about socio-economic transformation processes. These are shown to be conflict-ridden and full of tensions, creating pressures on socioeconomic orders and institutional logics. Because of this, development does not follow a neat pattern of convergence. In addition to identifying neglected issues and conceptual blind spots, the paper also outlines the scope for conceptual bridging between socio-technical and socio-economic transformation perspectives through attention to institutional logics and dialectics of change. We make a plea for a broader DT research agenda that covers relevant socio-economic rules, metaregimes and institutional contradictions. Attention to directionality helps to deal with three weaknesses of the DT framework: the assumption of convergence, materialism, and insufficient attention to the multitude of value orientations and logics.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to reflect on the implications for higher education of a rapidly changing global context, where technologies play a role in the propagation of unsustainable patterns of change. Drawing from research on science and technology studies as well as existing work on (higher) education for sustainability, it seeks to expose the multidimensional nature of these patterns to raise a series of questions for educators, particularly those in engineering, computer science and other technical disciplines, and inform structured curricular and organisational interventions. Design/methodology/approach Theoretical perspectives on unsustainable patterns of technological change are explored with the objective of informing how the mitigation of their evolution could be addressed in educational settings. Key themes in the sustainability and higher education literature are then identified with the purpose of informing curricular and organisational intervention. Findings Countering unsustainable patterns of technological change requires the development of key sustainability competencies within more technical disciplines, informed by concepts in science and technology studies. This requires change at curricular, organisational and institutional levels to enable spaces for inter- and transdisciplinary learning to be created, so that skills may be developed. Originality/value This paper reflects on unsustainable patterns of technological change, identifying challenges for educators, in particular those in more technical disciplines.

TI  - Accelerating Pathways to Net Zero: Governance Strategies from Transition Studies and the Transition Accelerator
T2  - CURRENT CLIMATE CHANGE REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose After decades of delay, there are promising signs that society may finally be getting serious about climate change. But the problem is now of such urgency that accelerating transition pathways to net zero is of paramount importance. Which governance approach gives society the best chance of simultaneously realizing the multiple sectoral and industrial transformations that net zero entails? How can policymakers and broader societal actors accelerate these transformative processes, setting in motion transition pathways to desirable futures? In response to these interrelated questions, we survey the literature on sustainability transitions and present an approach that aims directly at radical system change. Recent Findings Two decades of transition research has generated critical insights on accelerating transition pathways to net zero, highlighting key transformative strategies and pointing to the central role of the state, politics, and intermediaries. Transition research indicates that reaching net zero entails radically transforming essentially all sectors and industries as they are deeply entwined with the use of fossil fuels and the release of greenhouse gas emissions. An ambitious state in conjunction with a strong constellation of intermediary organizations can set in motion and accelerate transition pathways by actively driving niche development surrounding promising innovations, promoting the diffusion of emerging alternatives, and phasing out carbon-intensive arrangements.

TI  - Societal values, tensions and uncertainties in resource recovery from wastewaters
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The recovery of resources, including water reuse, has been presented as a solution to overcome scarcity, and improve the economic and environmental performance of water provision and treatment. However, its imple-mentation faces non-technical challenges, including the need to collaborate with new stakeholders and face societal acceptance issues. Looking at the prominence of the circular economy in current policy developments and the challenges to resource recovery, exploring these issues is urgently needed. In this work, we reviewed a broad range of literature to identify societal values relevant to the recovery of water and other resources from wastewaters, particularly urban and industrial wastewater and desalination brines. We discuss tensions and uncertainties around these values, such as the tension between socio-economic expectations of resource recovery and potential long-term sustainability impacts, as well as uncertainties regarding safety and regulations. For addressing these tensions and uncertainties, we suggest aligning common methods in engineering and the natural sciences with Responsible Innovation approaches, such as Value Sensitive Design and Safe-by-Design. To com-plement Responsible Innovation, social learning with a Sustainability Transitions or Adaptive Governance perspective is suggested.

T2  - ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to investigate transition pathways, identify transition failures and propose policy solutions based on functions of technological innovation system (TIS) to overcome transition failures in the wind turbine industry in Iran. To this end, this paper employs a qualitative approach and case study research strategy. In this regard, the historical evolution of the wind turbines in Iran from 1988 to 2020 is investigated through the lens of sustainable transitions pathways, the integrated theoretical framework (combination of technological innovation system and multi-level perspective) with identifying a kind of pathway in each. Then, the reasons for the transition fail-ure in each stage are extracted by employing a transition failure theoretical framework. Finally, to address the transition failures, appropriate policy solutions are proposed based on each function of the technological innova-tion system (TIS) theory. This paper contributes to the literature of sustainability transition by shedding light on the evolution of a renewable energy sector in a developing country with huge underground oil and gas reserves.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of International Energy Initiative.

TI  - Urban Living Labs: Pathways of Sustainability Transitions towards Innovative City Systems from a Circular Economy Perspective
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban living labs (ULLs) are progressive forms of interventions that aim to fulfil the sustainability ambitions of cities and communities. They provide opportunities to translate new ideas into practice. The increasing interest among researchers, practitioners, and policy makers in understanding sustainability transitions (ST) has brought new forms of experimentation through which cities and communities can be governed. Recently, there has been increasing attention towards the concept of circular economy (CE). This term promises the creation of distinct city systems in which material flows can be managed efficiently. In this article, we explore how ULLs can become pathways of sustainability transition towards innovative city systems from a circular economy perspective. By adopting a series of systematic analyses, i.e., multiple correspondence analysis and content analysis, we demonstrate the main pathways of circular economy-oriented innovative city systems that have been used in the literature. As a result of this work, we identify the main pathways, namely knowledge production, policy making, co-creation, geographical embeddedness, urban transitions, networks of cooperation among institutions, culture change, and collaborative engagement.

TI  - Disrupting to decarbonise socio-energy systems: The 'carbon transformation axes' framework
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The decarbonisation of socio-energy systems is a fundamental and urgent task to tackle the impending climate crisis effectively. To address this crucial challenge, the article adopts a novel normative/prescriptive, yet empirically informed, approach: the `carbon transformation axes' framework. Each axis lays out a pathway to disrupt the fossil bloc and decarbonise socio-energy systems; together, the axes provide not only an analytical tool for framing these processes, but also the crucial heuristics to support transformative narratives.The carbon transformation axes framework addresses the increasing fragmentation and compartmentalisation of transition studies by adopting a systemic perspective that considers how the fossil bloc thrives and pursues its interests; central to it is the consideration of how `agents of transformation' relate, interact, and apply collaborative ingenuity to disrupt all the ambits and ramifications relevant to the fossil bloc, thereby achieving the just and rapid decarbonisation of socio-energy systems in the public interest.This framework - to be used by a broad constituency of researchers and stakeholders - is empirically relevant, thanks to the combined support of observed evidence and `real world' demands.

TI  - Applying transdisciplinary sustainability transitions research in international social work doctoral training
T2  - SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last 15 years, transdisciplinary research of sustainability transitions has become an increasingly powerful approach. We discuss it as a perspective for social work discipline, and as a theoretical-conceptual frame of a new international doctoral training and research programme in social work taking place in seven European countries. In our qualitative study, we investigate how the participating social work doctoral students reflect upon transdisciplinarity and understand the interconnectivity between environmental, ecological, and social sustainability transitions-which is widely recognised as a highly complex challenge of sustainability. The data used included the students' learning diaries from the first summer school of this programme. As core findings of the analysis five joint themes expressing the interconnectivity emerged from the data: the indispensable role of nature for all life; the economy-based causes of unsustainability; the role of human rights; the researchers' own ways of life; and the practice-relevance for SW. Our results support recent theoretical arguments that transdisciplinarity comprises not only a disciplinary thinking but a way of being, where the holistic lives of researchers merge with the content of their work. Regarding our analysis of the pedagogical and didactic arrangements promoting transdisciplinary thinking, we can encourage direct collaboration and teaching inputs with other disciplines and demonstrable practice applications.

TI  - Intentional sustainable communities and sustainable development goals: from micro-scale implementation to scalability of innovative practices
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Intentional sustainable communities (ISCs) are commonly described as micro-based community initiatives that seek to develop sustainable lifestyles with low environmental impact. More recently, they have been analyzed as laboratories for the emergence of innovation, namely social innovation, and as actors that can contribute to sustainable transitions. This reinforces their role as pressure agents and as microscale communities of practice. Theoretically, it is argued that this scalability of innovation dynamics requires a multi-level and multi-actor perspective, mechanisms of reciprocity and that actors are not isolated and atomized. These mechanisms, such as networks, are crucial for the dissemination of sustainability practices and for increasing their potential impact. This article argues that these communities can also be important micro agents in achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and to mainstream the importance of scaling their innovation practices. To this end, the study uses quantitative data from a survey applied to the ISCs in Europe. The data corroborates the communities' contribution to the SDGs, namely to SDG12, SDG13 and SDG16 and presents the collaboration network structure established within these communities.

TI  - Energy efficiency in residential and non-residential buildings: Short-term macroeconomic implications
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Investments in energy efficiency are vital for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 given that changes in the structure of the main energy sources cannot be expected in the short to medium term. The greatest potential for energy savings and cutting emissions lies in buildings due to their significant carbon intensity and rapid growth rate. However, gaps remain in what is known about integrating decarbonisation of the built environment into the economy-wide system. The paper addresses such gaps by examining the socio-macroeconomic impli-cations of different scenarios related to building stock investments in a small open economy. The effectiveness of the measures implemented for various building types and the possibility of a rebound effect are also considered. The study is valuable for the peculiarities of the recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model, GreenMod Slovenia, which was established to analyse the effects of decarbonisation. Two major contributions emerge: (1) projected energy efficiency in buildings is presented separately for commercial services, public services and households in two investment scenarios, namely, the business-as-usual scenario and the energy efficiency scenario with additional investments; and (2) the disaggregation of households into income quintiles to project their consumption of energy inputs. The study reveals vital macroeconomic benefits flowing from the energy efficiency scenario, including higher GDP and employment. Second, energy efficiency improvements in commercial services might encourage higher energy consumption. Finally, low-income households reduced the consumption of energy products the least. In this quintile group, energy efficiency improvement can lead to greater energy consumption, denoting policy failure.

TI  - Implications of digitalization in facilitating socio-technical energy transitions in Europe
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The energy sector is digitalizing -we see a lot of smart energy services providing higher value to customers through data processing, which also increases the importance of transparency and security of data access and processing. Nevertheless, the widespread use of these services is lagging behind for enabling fundamental transitions of energy systems. This interdisciplinary article operationalises the MLP of sustainability transitions and draws together previous research on the application and implications of energy data and consumer moti-vation for analysing the imbalance between the supply and demand of smart energy services in the current energy transition. Besides drawing together the opportunities and challenges with energy data of 85 interna-tional smart energy services, the empirical findings present some new energy data use cases aimed especially for consumers and provide an extensive overview of additional data types with reasoning needed by service pro-viders. These findings are complemented with the more in-depth Estonian electricity sector digitalization case study. Furthermore, we propose a list of characteristics essential for Pan-European energy data access with the main aim to open up data, activate consumers and increase the demand of smart energy services for speeding up the green energy transition.

TI  - Mesoamerican urbanism:Indigenous institutions, infrastructure, and resilience
T2  - URBAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Mesoamerica was the most urbanised landscape of the precolonial Western Hemisphere, and urban dwellers there shared many cultural commonalities. They also varied significantly regarding what social institutions they emphasised, what forms of urban infrastructure they created, their fiscal financing and systems of governance, as well as how they managed ecological resources and risk. In this paper, we provide a comparative analysis of Mesoamerican cities using a database of archaeological indices of Indigenous urban characteristics. We report positive correlations between the longevity of cities in our sample and more collective institutions of governance, higher population densities, and more shared and equitably distributed forms of urban infrastructure. The study draws on Indigenous knowledge and practices to assist the target-based approach of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and New Urban Agenda and provides insights into how certain urban institutions and infrastructure can foster greater resilience and equity in the face of ecological and cultural-historical perturbations.

TI  - Impact on local sustainability of the northward expansion of human activities into protected areas in northern Tibet
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The negative marginal effect of spatial expansion of human activities on the ecology is increasing, which could easily lead to unsustainable development. However, the reasons for the expansion process and the combined impact on the ecosystem health of protected areas and the sustainable livelihoods of local residents are still vaguely known. Northern Tibet has important ecological service functions such as water conservation, windbreak and sand fixation, and plateau biodiversity, and is an ecological security barrier on a global scale. Based on multi-source data, this study describes the changing process of the boundary of human activities in northern Tibet. By establishing a sustainable living equilibrium model, using spatial analysis and the transformation measurement method, the causes of human activities encroaching on protected areas and their impact on ecology and pastoralist livelihoods are explored. The results showed that the boundary of grazing moved 118.7 km northward to the Qiangtang Protected Area from 1980 to 2015, resulting in the theoretical livestock carrying capacity of grasslands decreased by 5.4%, the overgrazing worsened by 6.8%, and the living standard of pastoralists widened with that of the whole Country. The factors leading to the expansion include population increase and consumption demand, increases in wildlife, lake expansion and grassland degeneration. The pastoralists' excessive dependence on animal husbandry is the main reason, contributing to more than 65% of the northward expansion. The feasible way to change this local unsustainable development is to make rational use of the ecological tourism function and service value of the protected areas.

TI  - Population-environment dynamics across world's top 100 urban agglomerations: With implications for transitioning toward global urban sustainability
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is a long-term global trend critical for shaping human-Earth sustainability in the Anthropocene. In past decades, much progress has been made in researching urban sustainability, particularly global assessments of the big picture and case studies of individual cities. Here we examine the world's top 100 urban agglomer-ations (UAs) in terms of size-that rank high on sustainability agendas and cover 28% of the global UA area --regarding four broadly concerned challenges: population shrinkage, slum development, greenness loss, and heat exposure. Instead of merely focusing on global/regional "averages" or individual cases, we take one step further to identify the "anomalies" of urban sustainability among the 100 UAs for each dimension and on the whole as multi-dimensional coupled infrastructure systems. Results show: (1) urban population of the 100 UAs increased by 36% during 2000-2020; (2) urban slums occurred in 85% of 34 examined UAs in the Global South; (3) urban greenness declined in the 100 UAs by 8% during 2000-2019; and (4) 79% of the 100 UAs were projected to have less than 30 EHDs per year during 2021-2030. Our findings provide global baselines for place -based problem-driven policymaking for the examined UAs and suggest improving urban green infrastructure as their top policy imperative. Our findings point to a critical research gap in the urban sustainability literature: Studying sustainability transitions of the "abnormally" sustainable UAs identified in this study that had excep-tional performances on the four examined sustainability dimensions, e.g., Beijing of China and Milan of Italy.

TI  - Understanding circular economy transitions: The case of circular textiles
T2  - BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The circular economy has been proposed to transform global textile supply chains which are currently challenged by a complex nexus of sustainability issues related to the dominant fast fashion trend. Research on circular economy in the textile sector often focuses on businesses or consumers as key enablers in circular transitions, yet it treats them as independent entities and thereby neglects the study of interactions that can provide insight at the systems level. The proclaimed "circular textile mission" in the Netherlands setting a national target for 100% circularity by 2050 is used as case study to address this research gap. We explore the circular textile transition processes found in the context of the Dutch mission and compare the development and interactions among various technical and non-technological solutions produced by engaged actor constellations for assessing key factors driving and blocking the overall mission fulfilment. To these ends, we derive a theoretical framework based on innovation system theory and conceptualize the Dutch circular textile transition as a Mission-oriented Innovation System (MIS). Analyzing the structure and functioning of the Dutch mission-oriented innovation system, we show that (1) there is a good match between the formal Dutch circular textile mission and system actor perceptions; (2) system actors have formed structures around three dominant solution trajectories in the Dutch system: secondhand, mechanical recycling, and chemical recycling; (3) these trajectories expose distinct key virtuous and vicious cycles, which characterize (4) the entire system as formative. Overall, the secondhand trajectory shows most developed structures and most positive dynamics, chemical recycling carries most technological breakthrough potential, whereas mechanical recycling is a mature technology but lacks market demand and supply. We compare the three solution trajectories, discuss the disruptive nature of the Dutch circular textile transition, and suggest installing Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) as a potential intervention for accelerating system transformation. The study concludes with reflections on the case learnings and considerations for further research on mission-oriented innovation systems.

TI  - Desert geographies: solar energy governance for just transitions
T2  - GLOBALIZATIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - While sustainability statements crowd national and urban visions, unjust implementation of lower-carbon energy infrastructures for climate mitigation manifests in contexts of marginal rurality. We focus on solar energy infrastructure rollout in Rajasthan in Western India to argue for a response centred on the energy practices of, and the effects of energy development on, politically marginal inhabitants. To that end, we consider what environmental governance arrangements under transition reveal about the recursive relationship between socio-material reconfiguration of the energy sector and co-evolving power relations and institutional structures. We propose and operationalize three concepts that can guide contextualized analyses of institutional, relational and socio-material change. These bridging concepts identify and inform pathways for just, publicly accountable transitions. We argue that environmental governance and energy geographies insights can orientate just transitions away from renewed extraction and growth-wedded economic paradigms prevalent in post-colonial geopolitics, and towards using appropriate technologies to attain decent living services.

TI  - Transitions to Sustainability Using Strategic Spatial Planning Designing Spatial Visions in the Coal Phase-out Process in Lusatia
T2  - DISP
M3  - Article
AB  - Alongside the decision to phase out coal in the energy system by 2038 at the latest, the German government is seeking to foster a sustainability transition in the affected lignite regions. In Lusatia, the most deprived coal region, however, peripheralisation trends and the experience of structural collapse in the 1990s mean that political debate is less concerned with addressing socio-ecological challenges than it is with economic stimulus, especially employment substitution. Aspects of sustainability, therefore, seem to be difficult to embed within the transition. Against this background, we ask what strategic spatial planning can offer to support the transformative aspirations of sustainability transitions. We address this question by reporting on a planning process that we implemented to create spatial visions for Lusatia. The planning process demonstrated both the potential and limitations of the implementation of a regional design format, especially as regards the participation of external design teams. By creating integrated, visual strategies with external perspectives, the process helped to fill gaps in the ongoing process of developing a regional strategy for the transition. At the same time, it highlighted difficulties related to the complexity of the transition challenges as well as the actors and structures tasked with addressing them.

TI  - The human-technical-environmental systems framework for sustainability analysis
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The field of sustainability science has grown significantly over the past two decades in terms of both conceptual development and empirical research. Systems-focused analysis is critical to building generalizable knowledge in the field, yet much relevant research does not take a systems view. Systems-oriented analytical frameworks can help researchers conceptualize and analyze sustainability-relevant systems, but existing frameworks may lack access or utility outside a particular research tradition. In this article, we outline the human-technical-environmental (HTE) framework, which provides analysts from different disciplinary backgrounds and fields of study a common way to advance systems-focused research on sustainability issues. We detail a step-by-step guide for the application of the HTE framework through a matrix-based approach for identifying system components, studying interactions among system components, and examining interventions targeting components and/or their interactions for the purpose of advancing sustainability. We demonstrate the applicability of the HTE framework and the matrix-based approach through an analysis of an empirical case of coal-fired power plants and mercury pollution, which is relevant to large-scale sustainability transitions. Based on this analysis, we identify specific insights related to the applicability of upstream and downstream leverage points, connections between energy markets and the use of pollution control technologies, and the importance of institutions fitting both biophysical dynamics and socioeconomic and political dynamics. Further application of the HTE framework and the identification of insights can help develop systems-oriented analysis, and inform societal efforts to advance sustainability, as well as contribute to the formulation of empirically grounded middle-range theories related to sustainability systems and sustainability transitions. We conclude with a discussion of areas for further development and application of the HTE framework.

TI  - Citizens' initiatives for sustainability transitions and dissemination: Forms and functions of territorial networking
T2  - DEVELOPPEMENT DURABLE & TERRITOIRES
M3  - Article
AB  - Citizens' initiatives for sustainable lifestyles have been multiplying all over Europe since the beginning of the 21st century. The literature emphasises that they bear visions, values and practices which slightly differ from the dominant societal model. Nevertheless, the crucial question of the capacity of such local initiatives to transform territories on a larger scale has not yet been addressed. In this article, we start with the hypothesis that the consolidation and dissemination of alternative values and practices within territories depends on the weaving of links between the actors of alternative projects and their networking. Based on the results of research on citizen initiatives in the Northern Alps and the Massif Central, this article highlights the forms and functions of such territorialized networks.

TI  - Transforming Institutions to Connect Land and Water for Healthy Communities
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Interconnected global environmental and societal risks threaten the health of human and ecological communities. Institutions are avenues through which people can mobilize to respond, but institutional landscapes are fragmented. We focus on the need for institutional change in environmental management and water services to better connect land and water in the United States. Using a historical institutionalist approach and insights from sustainability transitions research, we analyze four diverse examples of connecting land and water occurring across public and private institutions where people are putting innovative perspectives and principles into practice: National Environmental Policy Act, Engineering with Nature (R); Water Utilities as Anchor Institutions, and Growing Water Smart. Comparative analysis of these examples focuses on the particular risks these institutions are responding to, how each connects land and water to promote healthy communities, the institutional transformations that are occurring, how problems are being reframed, how leadership and mobilization are driving change, what tools help bridge multiple boundaries, and what new ways of knowing and action strategies are emerging. Our examples focus on transformations within and between institutions in recognition of their importance for driving larger system change. Findings reinforce previous research on the critical role of human agency and boundary spanning in facilitating and steering sustainability transitions.

TI  - Re-powering the Nature-Intensive Systems: Insights From Linking Nature-Based Solutions and Energy Transition
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE CITIES
M3  - Review
AB  - Nature-based and energy transition strategies are amongst most considerable solutions that are gaining popularity in recent years, especially in global north. This review provides a new approach to link these apparently independent concepts to highlight the potentials of coupled systems. Exploring common boundary concepts such as energy infrastructure, natural capital, land sink, ecosystem services etc. in both energy and environmental geography fields can facilitate our understanding toward potential contributions of nature-based solutions and energy transition for efficiency and sustainability goals. The results of this review can help to further develop robust coupled systems to deal with urban societal and environmental challenges such as land and energy scarcity. This review presents a variety of theoretical foundations and the rationales behind nature-based solutions and energy transition including socio-technical transitions, socio-ecological-technological, land-energy transition, and circular economy scholarships. Finally, by proposing future research directions, the role of each boundary concept in coupled NbS-ET systems is shown.

TI  - Amplifying actions for food system transformation: insights from the Stockholm region
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Food is essential to people and is one of the main ways in which people are connected to the world's ecosystems. However, food systems often cause ecosystem degradation and produce ill-health, which has generated increasing calls to transform food systems to be more sustainable. The Swedish food system is currently undergoing substantial change. A varied set of local actors have created alternative sustainability initiatives that enact new ways of doing, thinking, and organizing. These actors can increase the transformative impact of their initiatives through multiple actions and a variety of amplification processes. We analyzed the actions adopted by 29 food initiatives active in the Stockholm region using information available online. We conducted 11 interviews to better understand the amplification processes of speeding up (i.e., accelerating impact), scaling up (i.e., influencing higher institutional levels), and scaling deep (i.e., changing values and mind-sets). Our results indicated that the initiatives mainly seek to stabilize and grow their impact while changing the awareness, values, and mind-sets of people concerning the food they consume (scaling deep). However, these approaches raise new questions about whether these actions subvert or reinforce current unsustainable and inequitable system dynamics. We suggest there are distinct steps that local and regional governments could take to support these local actors via collaborations with coordinated forms of initiatives, and fostering changes at the municipality level, but these steps require ongoing, adaptive approaches given the highly complex nature of transformative change and the risks of reinforcing current system dynamics.

TI  - Adjustment or transformation? Disaster risk intervention examples from Austria, Indonesia, Kiribati and South Africa
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Change triggered by natural hazards such as pluvial and coastal floods, sea-level rise as well as risks resulting from water scarcity are highly dynamic and related to the effects of ongoing climate change. Whether and how societies adapt, adjust, change, or transform because of climate change and related risks, is a currently debated topic. This question demands revisiting and comprehensively addressing existing theoretical foundations of transformations in risk management strategies and in risk governance to find effective ways to deal with climate change effects and their social consequences. Hence, the paper discusses current developments in transformation research and exemplifies this discussion with four interdisciplinary cases, which the co-authors reported in previous publications. Findings from Austria include a governance change within flood risk management related to zonation. Relocation in Indonesia and Kiribati showcases its cultural, behavioural as well as economic implications. Water scarcity in South Africa underlines the importance of behavioural change to enable the structural storage of rainwater. This paper analyses aspects of adjustment or transformation in these four examples. This may inform risk managers, decision-makers, practitioners, and planners dealing with natural hazards related to climate change how to conceptualise their (re-)actions.

TI  - Towards a Science of Scaling for Urban Climate Action and Governance
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RISK REGULATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The scaling of urban climate action and its governance is rapidly becoming a central focus in the urban climate governance literature and policy debates. Building on the broader scaling literature and inspired by related initiatives in other fields, this article calls for the development of a systematic "science of scaling" for urban climate governance. Such a science of scaling may help to give a better understanding of how well-performing urban climate action and its governance can be multiplied, accelerated and broadened (ie horizontal and vertical scaling and scaling out, up and down), and it may help to uncover scaling trajectories towards systemic change in cities (ie deep scaling).

TI  - Social movements in energy transitions: The politics of fossil fuel energy pathways in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Poland
T2  - EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pathways towards low-carbon energy transitions have become a priority in 21st century Europe. The commitment to lowering carbon dioxide emissions have triggered changes to current fossil fuel-based energy systems. Over the past decade, fossil fuel energy pathways have been characterized by closures of sites, continued extractions and new explorations, demonstrating processes of (dis)continuation. This paper contributes to the recent line of work that draws attention to the contentious politics in sustainability transitions and the role of social movements by drawing on case study work in which we trace social mobilizations alongside key policy and industry developments linked to onshore oil and gas and coal projects in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Poland over the past ten years. Drawing on the notion of scalar practices, we identify political strategies and opportunities for the discontinuation of fossil fuels, but we also examine how political spaces are impinged and closed down to support continuation processes. Our analysis demonstrates how decision-making powers and possibilities for scrutinizing and taking actions against fossil fuels are negotiated between local and central government, local communities and residents, grassroots movements, national NGOs, and fossil fuel industries. We conclude that all actors are involved in scalar practices, and non-fossil energy pathways remain challenging if the government and industry actors keep trying to displace the politics linked to fossil fuel energy.

TI  - Action research for energy system transformation
T2  - EDUCATIONAL ACTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Responding to the climate crisis requires a large-scale transformation of energy systems away from fossil fuels toward a more distributed, equitable, renewable-based society. The societal benefits of this transformation which could redistribute power, literally and figuratively, go well beyond decarbonization; a renewable society could also be a healthier, more economically just society. This study conceptualizes action researchers as key drivers of these systemic change processes. We argue that transforming and democratizing energy systems should be the focal point of action researcher's efforts to address climate change. To advance this argument, the study draws on the systemic action research, energy democracy, and sustainability transitions literature and includes recommendations, examples, and practical suggestions for conducting energy-related action research. This study's findings will be useful to researchers interested in engaging the climate crisis by building transformative capacity in the context of local and regional energy systems.

TI  - Ten financial actors can accelerate a transition away from fossil fuels
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Investors have a central role to play in sustainability transitions, due to their inordinate influence on the governance of the fossil fuel extraction industry. Using network analysis, this paper links fossil fuel firms to equity owners, by distinguishing ownership characteristics of top shareholders and establishing a ranked list of the most prevalent shareholders based on emissions potential and network centrality. Our study reveals that among the most prevalent owners, are government signatories of the Paris accord and prominent American investment managers. We conclude that a concentrated number of investors have the potential to influence the strategic direction and governance of these firms and should consequently be held accountable for financing the economic activities that contribute to climate instability. This paper directly contributes to the fragmented body of academic research on financial systems and sustainability transitions.

TI  - Impact of local environmental standards on water environmental carrying capacity in large water diversion project: A system dynamics analysis in Shandong, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Large water diversion projects have extensive impact on the water systems in the receiving areas, where inevitable regional responses are aroused and alert to local environmental carrying capacity. To ensure the water quality of China's eastern South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP), Shandong Province had issued strict local wastewater discharge standards since 2006. However, some flexibility exists in the enforcement of local standards, which created uncertainty to the outcomes. A system dynamic (SD) model and Water Environmental Carrying Capacity (WECC) method were integrated to dynamically illustrate the interaction between the enforcement of the local standards and the performance of the regional water system. The WECC was calculated based on an indicator system representing the multi-dimensional impact of the local standards on the regional water system. The SD model was constructed to simulate and forecast the variations of those indicators of WECC. The SD-WECC model was trained and validated with yearly data from 2000 to 2020, then four scenarios with different levels of enforcement of local standards were illustrated. The results showed that overall WECC improves during period from 2000 to 2025, and that the SNWDP improves the balance of water supply and demand in Shandong in the long run in the three scenarios that have introduced the local standards. The adoption of the local standard helps the concentration of industrial Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) discharge to meet the discharging standards earlier by stimulating the investment in pollution control. Therefore, the flexibility in local water environment management enabled the local actors to pursue a balance between environmental protection and economic growth in a dynamic context with multi-objects for local development.

TI  - How global regimes diffuse in space - Explaining a missed transition in San Diego's water sector
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Socio-technical regimes are highly institutionalized rationalities that have co-evolved with actors, technologies and institutions over extended periods of time and become taken for granted across geographical contexts. Transition studies feature an extensive focus on regime dynamics within specific territorial contexts. However, we know surprisingly little of how regime rationalities are constructed, diffused and reproduced across space. This is a key gap in the geography of sustainability transitions literature. This paper introduces a conceptual model to analyze trans formative opportunities in regions and how regime actors strategically diffuse and implement global regime solutions through combinations of discursive and substantive system reconfiguration activities. The empirical analysis draws upon a combination of Socio-Technical Configuration Analysis (STCA) of 354 newspaper articles and 10 in-depth expert interviews to illuminate how regime actors prevailed in diffusing and legitimizing the water sector's dominant socio-technical configuration in San Diego during a period of substantial transformative opportunities.

TI  - Systems thinking as a paradigm shift for sustainability transformation
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted as reference and universal guidepost for transitioning to Sustainable Development by the United Nations in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, are intended to be used as a set of interconnected goals and global targets for 'Transforming our world', as the 2030 Agenda is titled. This is a far more challenging task than business as usual; it requires systems thinking for understanding the conditions that generate and propagate sustainability challenges, moving away from the reductionist and anthropocentric thinking that created them in the first place. Taking a systems approach to addressing these challenges has been gaining currency with academics and policymakers alike, and here we make the case for holistic, integrated, and interdisciplinary thinking that challenges assumptions and world views, crucially based on public participation and engagement, to create the enabling conditions for sustain ability to emerge. System transformations require interconnected changes to technologies, social practices, business models, regulations and societal norms, an intentional process designed to fundamentally alter the components and structures that cause the system to behave in its current unsustainable ways, a paradigm shift enabling the transition to sustainability.

T2  - POLICY AND POLITICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods, earthquakes, droughts, and other recurrent disasters around the globe have sparked renewed interest in whether and how disasters can be leveraged as turning points for transformation toward more sustainable and resilient societies. As the transformative potential of disasters increasingly gains prominence in different research fields, it is important to describe how different scientific approaches view the relationship. This article synthesises key insights from the policy sciences and public administration scholarship regarding the link between disruptive disaster events and policy activity aiming towards societal transformation. Key explanatory perspectives are discussed, including dynamics associated with institutional crisis, policy subsystems, agenda-setting and issue salience, governance capacity, policy-oriented learning and concentration of power, and situated in relation to four scenarios of potential disaster impacts on policymaking aiming at transformation. The results of this synthesis seek to enhance our understanding of when disasters may spark transformative change. Based on these findings, the article identifies priorities for future research into policymaking in the wake of disaster.

TI  - Governing translocal experimentation in multi-sited transition programs: Dynamics and challenges
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Transition experiments are important instruments to foster sustainability transitions. Transition scholars increasingly suggest investigating how multiple local experiments can become connected across spatial scales, and how transformative dynamics of multiple connected experiments can be facilitated and governed. In this paper we analyze the different types of translocal dynamics involved in simultaneously governing multiple experiments in multi-sited transition programs, by empirically exploring the FIT4FOOD2030 program (2017-2020) that supported 25 transition experiments. Then, we present four overarching challenges in governing translocal experimentation: (1) finding synergies between diverging local needs and program ambitions; (2) navigating the cross-scale political dynamics in multi-sited transition programs; (3) moving beyond outputoriented evaluation frameworks in order to capture transformative efforts of short-term programs; and (4) expanding the boundaries of programs by linking to ongoing policy developments in highly complex multi-level governance settings. We hope our work can inform transition governance efforts in fostering transformative translocal dynamics toward sustainability.

TI  - The versatile role of sustainable market entrepreneurs in market transformation: An intervention framework for institutional change
T2  - BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This article investigates in which way sustainable entrepreneurship can generate institutional change that transforms markets towards sustainability. A transformation of models of economic organization and market structures through sustainable entrepreneurship fosters the path towards sustainability. Institutional change involves sustainable market entrepreneurs as institutional entrepreneurs that operate in an effectual manner in different market transformation phases. Sustainable market entrepreneurs while seeking entrepreneurial opportunities simultaneously shape existing market structures and market conditions in different sustainable market transformation phases thereby creating new opportunities. Accordingly, a framework that explains institutional change prompted by sustainable market entrepreneurs in market transformation phases is developed. In this framework, various interventions which encourage sustainable market entrepreneurs to co-create with the stakeholders of their choice are strategized. The provided framework enhances the understanding of the versatile role of sustainable market entrepreneurs and potentially the leverage of their actions towards institutional impact over time.

AB  - In recent years, scholars from diverse research communities have become greatly interested in the experimental turn within the social sciences and economics. A rapidly emerging field within the literature on experimentation is investigating urban experimentation to promote sustainability transitions. Emphasising the situatedness of experiments, such publications are shedding light on the particularities of places and spaces. Experimentation conducted in real-world settings seeks to combine purposeful intervention with observation and reflection. In the study of urban experimentation, various disciplinary lenses and conceptual frameworks have emerged, especially in the two literatures on sustainability transitions and environmental governance. This has fostered a more complex, differentiated understanding of experimentation. The literature review presented here seeks to elaborate current lines of inquiry on urban experimentation in order to gain insight into how experimentation shapes urban sustainability transitions. By outlining the complementary and contrasting nature of different academic perspectives, it is possible to identify avenues of future research and encourage dialogue between the different research communities.

TI  - Unpacking the Psychosocial Dimension of Decarbonization between Change and Stability: A Systematic Review in the Social Science Literature
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper provides a systematic overview of the psychosocial contribution to decarbonization studies and critically discusses current trends. Following the PRISMA protocol, we reviewed 404 articles informing how socio-psychological processes affect decarbonization, and vice versa, and highlighting research gaps and biases. Contrary to criticisms about methodological individualism and reductionism of socio-psychological research on sustainability, the review illustrates that the field is equally attentive to psychosocial processes operating at different levels, including the individual (e.g., attitudes, stress, environmental concerns), community (e.g., collective identity, justice, sense of place), and socio-cultural levels (e.g., social norms, values, memory). However, evidence shows some problematic trends in the literature: (i) A bias toward specific agents and geographies, which overlooks mesoscale actors (e.g., media, unions, NGOs) and developing and eastern countries; (ii) instrumental and normative views of transitions, which coincide with a prevailing focus on cognitive processes and a selective bias toward technologies, policies, places, and natural resources conceived as instrumental to decarbonization. This also emphasizes how biophysical processes, people-nature relationships, and the role of emotions in understanding the psychology of agents and decarbonization processes are almost absent; (iii) a research gaze normatively oriented toward the future, which risks neglecting continuity-discontinuity dynamics and the timing and pace of transitions.

TI  - Environmental Conflicts and Social Innovation on the Balearic Islands (Spain)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - New environmental conflicts arise all the time as a consequence of the industrial economy and economic growth. The search for new energy and new materials jeopardizes the margin to promote sustainable development in many local communities. In this paper, we examine a conflict related to hydrocarbons projects in the Balearic Sea (Spain) from the social innovation perspective. This novel approach allows us to focus on how socially innovative responses can be triggered by environmental threats. A set of mixed methods (qualitative analysis and social network analysis) are implemented to study the emergence and development of Alianza Mar Blava in Ibiza-Formentera. This is an initiative that successfully activates new social relations and new collective practices that contribute to transform the environmental conflict. In this study, we highlight the strategic factors that allow the conflict to be transformed as well as other social processes that ultimately promote local sustainable development beyond the conflict.

TI  - Exploring the interplay between technological decline and deinstitutionalisation in sustainability transitions
T2  - TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The decline side of transitions is an emerging study, which advances thinking on regime destabilisation, technology decline and phase-out policies. Previous research has predominantly focused on the complete phase out of specific unsustainable technologies as desirable or possible, but it has given less attention to how these technological aspects interweave with institutional elements in ways that may constrain or enable system transformations. Our research develops a framework that clarifies the nuanced relationships between technological decline and the dissipation of institutional elements as distinct but interrelated processes. Through a longitudinal case study, we used the framework to examine the decline of unsustainable drainage technologies in Melbourne, Australia. These technologies are embedded within existing institutional elements, i.e. routines, rules, roles, and meanings that govern how stormwater should be managed. The near-full decline of one type of the drainage technologies is enabled by mixing old and new institutional elements. We found that the dissipation of multiple elements using combined mechanisms is important to achieve this partial decline outcome, and more attention needs to be paid to the effects of institutional remnants in constraining systems transformations.

TI  - Enabling sustainable food transitions in schools: a systemic approach
T2  - BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Recent reviews and reports have highlighted the need for integrated, context-specific efforts to enable sustainable food transitions. This study aimed to identify pathways to promote healthier and more environmentally friendly food practices in school contexts, with a focus on increased plant-based eating. Design/methodology/approach The study used a systemic approach with data collected from relevant stakeholders in an EU country (Portugal) at diverse levels of influence in the school meals system (i.e. proximal, intermediate, distal; from end-consumers to food providers, market actors, civil society organizations, and policy and decision-makers). Data from individual interviews (N = 33) were subjected to thematic analysis. Findings Meat-centric cultural perceptions of a 'proper meal' can be a socio-emotional barrier for sustainable food transitions in schools. Main pathways identified to unlock these transitions included: (1) Levering orientations toward ethical and environmentally beneficial consumption; (2) Improving and increasing the offer of plant-based meals; and (3) Mobilizing local communities and society. Originality/value The current findings suggest that promoting healthier and more environmentally friendly food practices in schools requires systemic, integrated approaches which focus on food consumption, food provision, and the broader political and sociocultural environment.

TI  - The twofold transition: Framing digital innovations and incumbents' value propositions for sustainability
T2  - BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although digital technology offers many sustainable business model opportunities, they are not always exploited. We argue that the framing of technology is still rarely considered a cognitive antecedent of business models for sustainability, despite that it offers insightful explanations, connecting technology's sustainability potential to its business model implementations. We conduct a qualitative multicase study of virtual power plants, adopted by seven incumbent companies in the German energy sector, and explore how they frame innovative digital technology, as well as how it affects their value propositions and the energy transition. Our research reveals several value proposition differences between two company groups. The first generates a single-focused technological frame, concentrating on economic value. The second constructs a twofold digital and sustainable technological frame, resulting in additional socioenvironmental value components. Overall, companies that create a twofold frame operate as renewable energy enablers or system supporters and contribute to the energy transition.

TI  - Polycentric energy governance: Under what conditions do energy communities scale?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As the polycentric nature of climate governance becomes ever more apparent, understanding the role played by individual initiatives becomes an increasingly urgent research priority. In recent years, community initiatives have blossomed in relation to clean energy, both in their overall number and diversity. Polycentric governance thinking offers a powerful but incomplete account of how and why such initiatives emerge, grow, and replicate in different contexts, that is, how they "scale." This article investigates the conditions under which different clean energy communities scale. Based on a systematic literature review, it identifies 23 separate conditions, which are subsequently categorized into what happens within, between and in the context of individual initiatives. As well as enriching polycentric governance thinking, this article identifies practical ways to inform and facilitate the emergence of new community initiatives.

TI  - Earth stewardship: Shaping a sustainable future through interacting policy and norm shifts
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - Transformation toward a sustainable future requires an earth stewardship approach to shift society from its current goal of increasing material wealth to a vision of sustaining built, natural, human, and social capital-equitably distributed across society, within and among nations. Widespread concern about earth's current trajectory and support for actions that would foster more sustainable pathways suggests potential social tipping points in public demand for an earth stewardship vision. Here, we draw on empirical studies and theory to show that movement toward a stewardship vision can be facilitated by changes in either policy incentives or social norms. Our novel contribution is to point out that both norms and incentives must change and can do so interactively. This can be facilitated through leverage points and complementarities across policy areas, based on values, system design, and agency. Potential catalysts include novel democratic institutions and engagement of non-governmental actors, such as businesses, civic leaders, and social movements as agents for redistribution of power. Because no single intervention will transform the world, a key challenge is to align actions to be synergistic, persistent, and scalable.

TI  - Climate change and COP26: Are digital technologies and information management part of the problem or the solution? An editorial reflection and call to action
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The UN COP26 2021 conference on climate change offers the chance for world leaders to take action and make urgent and meaningful commitments to reducing emissions and limit global temperatures to 1.5 & nbsp;C above preindustrial levels by 2050. Whilst the political aspects and subsequent ramifications of these fundamental and critical decisions cannot be underestimated, there exists a technical perspective where digital and IS technology has a role to play in the monitoring of potential solutions, but also an integral element of climate change solutions. We explore these aspects in this editorial article, offering a comprehensive opinion based insight to a multitude of diverse viewpoints that look at the many challenges through a technology lens. It is widely recognized that technology in all its forms, is an important and integral element of the solution, but industry and wider society also view technology as being part of the problem. Increasingly, researchers are referencing the importance of responsible digitalization to eliminate the significant levels of e-waste. The reality is that technology is an integral component of the global efforts to get to net zero, however, its adoption requires pragmatic tradeoffs as we transition from current behaviors to a more climate friendly society.

TI  - Revisiting the Missing Link: An Ecological Theory of Money for a Regenerative Economy
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Money is critical for a regenerative future. Transforming it is an unavoidable social, political, and economic endeavor that must be a global priority if we are to prevent future financial crises, reduce economic inequality and adhere to our climate agreements and sustainability goals. For this transition to occur, we urgently need new economic and monetary paradigms that address the root causes of our current unsustainability, offer a new monetary ontology and design, and, more importantly, steer our monetary regime towards the regeneration of our social, economic and ecological landscapes. We need an ecological understanding of money grounded in Ecological Economics and an Ecological Value Theory that lays down the foundations for the conscious democratization, decentralization, and diversification of money. In this work, we revisit and update the missing link between money and sustainability by proposing new ontological avenues and reviewing the design elements and degenerative processes built into the existing system. We also contribute to the development and emergence of an Ecological Monetary Economics by systematizing the ongoing monetary transition toward sustainability and by offering a set of principles drawn from the regenerative economics literature for the conscious design of monetary ecosystems that contribute positively to solving our societal challenges of the 21st century.

TI  - Toward Accelerating Sustainability Transitions through Collaborative Sustainable Business Modeling: A Conceptual Approach
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainability transitions are purposeful and require deliberate collective action from multiple organizations, leading to the necessity to adopt new business models and redesign value networks. In both business model and sustainability transition research, the explicit activities needed to re-shape value creation and capture systems of organizations are largely unaddressed. We aim to fill this gap by proposing collaborative sustainable business modeling (CSBMing) as a participative multi-actor approach aimed at value network innovation to accelerate sustainability transitions. To do this, we first conceptualize a sustainability transition as a business ecosystem change. We then introduce the value network as the interceding level connecting the individual business to the wider ecosystem, which upon scaling, can change the ecosystem, leading to transition. CSBMing aims to redesign value networks and may thus be used as an actionable approach to accelerate transitions. Second, through the multi-level perspective, we explain how CSBMing can scale, influence other value networks, and change the ecosystem. Third, we recognize that scaling value networks might need more than just implementation of a CSBM and show how elements of CSBMing can complement executing transition management activities. We illustrate the potential role of CSBMing in accelerating transitions through two examples from the Dutch energy transition. In all, we show that CSBMing can be a fruitful approach to innovate and scale value networks, create collective action needed for sustainability transitions, and contribute to transition management activities.

TI  - How to swarm? Organizing for sustainable and equitable food systems transformation in a time of crisis
T2  - GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY-AGRICULTURE POLICY ECONOMICS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accelerating food systems transformation in the face of climate change and other global crises requires myriad changes across all levels, themes, and geographies. This calls for re-thinking the roles of agricultural research for development (AR4D). In this perspective article we use the metaphor of 'swarms' and 'swarming' to illustrate a more distributed way of working with a set of approaches that, if implemented jointly, may help AR4D researchers and their institutions to step up the pace and scale for food systems transformation, as urgently called for in global dialogues around the UN Food System Summit, COP 26, and beyond. We identify four roles for AR4D within swarmed design: facilitating the directionality of swarms, fostering swarm mentality and creativity, engaging with swarms in different innovation spaces, and building up and monitoring swarm intelligence. Enacting these roles would require an enabling environment, with the main food systems actors working together in four priority areas: aligning allies around shared visions and innovation portfolios, coupling tailored funding schemes and reworked incentive systems, building more permanent spaces for boundary work, and exploring new ways for structuring science.

TI  - Sustainability-oriented labs in transitions: An empirically grounded typology
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainability is high on the political agenda, with its analytical and practical importance underscored in the field of sustainability transitions. Experiments, arenas, and laboratories are frequently highlighted as real-world objects to investigate sustainability in place. Despite existing lab studies, attempts at comparison at the empirical level remain unconvincing. Here, sustain ability remains oversimplified, warranting further investigation to unpack how labs compare in their orientation towards sustainability. This article presents a rigorous and transparent empirically grounded typology, intended to discern ways to engage with sustainability. We outline and elaborate upon six distinctive types entitled: 1) Fix and control, 2) (Re-)Design and optimize, 3) Make and relate, 4) Educate and engage, 5) Empower and govern, and 6) Explore and shape. This study highlights similarities and differences between labs, and across different types. These findings are discussed with reference to ongoing conceptualizations on directionality, providing a fruitful point of departure for ongoing transitions research.

TI  - Conceptualizing controversies in the EU circular bioeconomy transition
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - The transition towards a circular bioeconomy (CBE) in the European Union is not without contestation. In particular, research has highlighted potential trade-offs of the large-scale production of bio-resources, for instance with environmental quality goals. To date, however, it remains underexplored in the CBE literature how controversies develop throughout a transition process. To address this gap, this paper explores where controversies are situated in a transition, how they change throughout, and how they influence the transition process. First, we suggest that controversies can be situated on and between different system layers within a transition. Second, we offer an explanation of how controversies evolve, as actors confirm, integrate, disintegrate and polarize underlying storylines. Third, these controversies can have both productive and unproductive outcomes while they unfold throughout a transition. We illustrate this understanding with the example of biorefineries as CBE key technology and discuss a research agenda on controversies in sustainability transitions.

TI  - Community financing for sustainable food and farming: a proximity perspective
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
M3  - Article
AB  - An increasing number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the German organic agri-food sector involves citizens through different community financing models. While such models provide alternative funding sources as well as marketing opportunities to SMEs, they allow private investors to combine their financial and ethical concerns by directly supporting the development of a more sustainable food system. Due to the low level of financial intermediation, community financing is characterized by close relations between investors and investees. Against this background, we apply the proximity concept from economic geography to explore spatial and relational aspects of community financing in the German organic agri-food sector. Based on a qualitative multiple case study approach, we find that the relevance of proximity is twofold. While different forms of proximity between SMEs and their potential investors are key success factors, proximity is also considered as one desired outcome of community financing. Furthermore, our results reveal that the extent to which SMEs rely on particular proximity dimensions distinguishes two different approaches to community financing.

TI  - Material circularity in large organizations: Action-research to shift information technology (IT) material flows
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Policy proposals for a more circular economy abound but studies of actual attempts to transition from linear to more circular material flows within large organisations are few. We present the case of a university's project to manage its information technology (IT) material flows according to circular economy principles. This paper presents a detailed discussion of the strategies and governance mechanisms that were implemented to achieve this objective, the challenges faced and how they were addressed, and recommendations for similar interventions elsewhere, based on the lessons learned. Because of the first author's involvement in the planning and implementation of the project, the work serves as an example of action-research in transition management for sustainability. Unsustainable material flows, and barriers to implementing circular economy objectives, are presented as subsets of broader sustainability challenges that can be addressed through transition management experiments. We argue that action-research in transition management can help to understand and steer change, and to theorize about the complex systems shaping information technology (IT) material flows at the sub-economy level.

TI  - A Governance Framework for Implementation of Scientific and Engineering Innovation in Buried Infrastructure Systems
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE CITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article draws on experience within a pervasive sensing research project, the Pipebots project. The aim of the project is to design miniature robots to gather physical condition and environmental data on buried pipe networks, using potable water distribution and wastewater pipe systems as the initial target applications. One of the challenges of the project is to anticipate and address the potential governance issues triggered by the project. Due to the lack of a suitable tool with sufficient breadth to guide thinking, the existing literature has been drawn upon to form the basis of a governance framework for use in infrastructure projects. Whilst the original intention was to be alert to and interrogate the forms of governance that may impact on new infrastructure interventions, what is emerging is a tool that would support the strategy for implementation, improve the design (a no-regrets design policy) and help build the business case for the transformational change the project envisages.

TI  - Toward a digital transformation of the theory of the firm: Emergence as framework for organizational sustainability
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES-REVUE CANADIENNE DES SCIENCES DE L ADMINISTRATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Embracing methodological individualism, the mainstream economic theory of the firm has little to say about the precarious nature of the firm's embeddedness in encompassing socioecological systems. The digital transformation of the theory of the firm can address this gap by deconstructing the standpoint of methodological individualism. In transaction cost economics, this standpoint is manifest in two assumptions about human nature, namely bounded rationality and opportunism. Drawing on Chester Barnard's insights on the firm, the present paper seeks to construct a view of organizations as emergent systems irreducible to the activities of participating individuals. By inverting the assumptions of bounded rationality and opportunism, the paper differentiates between two varieties of the emergent nature of the firm, cognitive and moral. The ideas of the cognitive and moral emergence of the firm expand the pallet of options for the firm to adapt to socioecological systems and illuminate the notion of sustainability transitions. This way, the digitally enhanced understanding of the firm offers hope for a better dialogue between the economic theory of the firm, sustainability scholarship, and business ethics.

TI  - National innovation systems and sustainability: What is the role of the environmental dimension?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Innovation systems can play a decisive part in the globally coordinated efforts towards creating a sustainable future. However, the research that bridges national innovation systems and sustainability is scant. This study seeks to contribute to bridging this gap by exploring the relationships between national innovation systems and environmental sustainability at the country level. The multiple regression analysis shows that developed national innovation systems can enhance environmental sustainability at the country level, which should be accompanied by a transition towards sustainable consumption behavior and business practices. This study suggests that developing national innovation systems to foster environmental sustainability should encompass systemic changes that nurture and mold the multiple national innovation systems' factors and enable (environmentally) sustainable outputs. Implications of the findings for policy, theory, and management are discussed before concluding with the study's limitations and suggestions for future research.

TI  - Cities and the SDGs: Realities and possibilities of local engagement in global frameworks
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - City action is critical to achieving global visions for sustainability such as the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, SDG 'localisation' is complex procedure, with divergent outcomes depending on context and diverse city processes. This paper considers the operational challenges faced by city actors in taking on the SDGs, and subsequent implications for initiating local (and global) sustainability transitions. We analyse emergent approaches to SDG localisation within the Asia-Pacific, using a policy analysis framework (transition management) to assess transformation potential. We find that SDG localisation can influence urban sustainability, but effective implementation requires sufficient data, resourcing, and guidance-which are not readily, nor equally available to all city governments. City-to-city peer learning can accelerate SDG uptake, but realising the transformative ambition set out by the SDGs will require an approach to localisation that clearly demonstrates why and how any city government can and should engage with global sustainability frameworks.

TI  - Disasters as Enablers of Negotiation for Sustainability Transition: A Case from Odaka, Fukushima
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Disaster risk at the community level is likely to increase as climate change worsens. In this study, the author investigated the impact of disasters on negotiation for community development, particularly as a promoter of sustainability negotiation. Studies on agenda setting in policy making and critical moments in negotiation were thoroughly reviewed. Based on the review, the author presents an extraordinary case of the Odaka community from Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. This community experienced a critical moment in the negotiation of its development after the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011 and a subsequent nuclear disaster. The community also experienced a 5-year-long forced evacuation due to nuclear contamination from the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power station. This case reveals a major shift in four aspects of negotiation-parties, interests, relationship, and legitimacy-and a transition to more sustainable developments. It also demonstrates the possibility that disasters can enable negotiation for more sustainable development patterns by transforming the associated settings.

TI  - The Role of Farmers' Umbrella Organizations in Building Transformative Capacity around Grassroots Innovations in Rural Agri-Food Systems in Guatemala
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Family farmers and grassroots innovations can enable transitions to more sustainable food systems. The study explores the roles umbrella farmers' organizations play in building transformative capacity through grassroots innovations in rural food systems in Guatemala. An analytical framework based on the notion of transformative capacity and socio-technical transitions is used to explore the specific factors enabling and limiting the transformative potential of grassroots innovations in a rural setting. A case study in rural Huehuetenango, Guatemala is presented, using interviews and focus groups discussions with relevant stakeholders engaged in the development process. Perceptions from interviews and focus groups discussions highlight the catalyst role played by the umbrella farmers' organization as the main enabling factor to increase transformative capacity of grassroots innovations. The umbrella organization plays a key role in enabling farmers to pursue socio-technical transformations and in moving grassroots innovations outside a niche sphere. It contributes to creating coherence towards a common sustainability vision, supporting innovation and experimentation, and providing technical assistance around core development processes. In addition, it navigates across different levels of agency (households, communities, networks, and institutions) and different interaction scales (local, department, and national). However, gender and multi-generational gaps have been identified as limiting factors that would require further analysis.

TI  - The Role of Actor Networks in Enabling Agroecological Innovation: Lessons from Laos
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we use conceptual insights from the actor-network theory (ANT) to explore the role of agroecological innovation systems (AeISs) in the reconfiguration of agricultural practices toward sustainability. AeISs are actor networks involving a diversity of individuals (e.g., farmers, traders, experts) and organizations (e.g., cooperatives, rural development agencies, teaching and research institutions) that mainstream agroecology principles and practices to enhance agroecosystems' resilience. Their composition and structure affect the way different agents of change interact, as well as how they access, exchange, and use knowledge as they drive the adoption of specific technologies. We document seven AeISs that were active between 2005 and 2020 in the northern uplands of Laos. Within the framework of these initiatives, action research was conducted for understanding the processes underpinning diverse technical, organizational, and institutional innovations to foster an agroecological transition. Building on a comparative analysis of AeIS, we consider how agency was distributed among collectives as they reorganized in time. Our discussion highlights the importance of configuring, enlarging, and nurturing spaces in which actors are empowered to adjust and adapt, as well as to think and act collectively in complexity. Lastly, what counts in the innovation is the underlying networking process itself, i.e., the process through which all actors of the AeIS interact and exchange. Changes in the networking processes come with a changing conception of knowledge. Moving from knowledge to knowing (i.e., knowledge in the making), AeISs no longer only promote products or technologies, but also collective intelligence based on an ethic of care.

TI  - E ffective governance of circular economies: An international comparison
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focuses on a comparative study of the governance of Circular Economy (CE) in sixteen different countries. The analysis rests on a theoretical framework of insights gained in transition management literature and public administration, particularly network governance. It is assumed that two forms of governance are needed to cope with the complex circular economy transition process: public and network governance. The hypothesis was that in order to implement CE effectively, strong leadership of government, active involvement of stakeholders and receptivity to network governance are crucial. Based on the analysis described in this paper, two models have been designed that refine the original hypothesis: a model on the effectiveness of CE governance and a model that presents four main avenues for developing CE in different socio-cultural and political contexts. It is recommended to continue exploring this area of research, which is underexamined in the literature.

TI  - Discursive dynamics and lock-ins in socio-technical systems: an overview and a way forward
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the dynamics of stability and change is key to accelerate sustainability transitions. This paper aims to advance and inspire sustainability transition research on this matter by collecting insights from interpretative environmental discourse literature. We develop a heuristic that identifies and describes core discursive elements and dynamics in a socio-technical system. In doing so, we show how the interplay of meta-, institutionalized, and alternative discourses, dominant, marginal, and radical narratives, as well as weak and strong discursive agency influence the socio-technical configuration. The heuristic suggests three discursive lock-ins reinforcing the stabilization of socio-technical systems: unchallenged values and assumptions, incumbents' discursive agency, and narrative co-optation. Furthermore, it explores three pathways of discursive change: disruptive, dynamic and cross-sectoral. Overall, this paper puts forward a discursive perspective on sustainability transitions. It offers additional analytical approaches and concepts for discursive transition studies, elaborated insights on the dynamics within and between the analytical dimensions of a socio-technical system, as well as a theoretical baseline for analyzing discursive lock-in mechanisms and pathways of discursive change.

TI  - Cultures of transformation: An integrated framework for transformative action
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The challenges posed by climate change have generated many initiatives that seek to implement societal transformations. In most cases, these focus on technology developments, adoption and diffusion but neglect the social and cultural dimensions of a transformation. Insights from systems and behavioural sciences can provide valuable guidance on these aspects, but the utility of this literature is limited by two factors. Firstly, the literature on the intersection between social transformation and psychological processes of behaviour change by individuals is limited. Secondly, the complex technical nature of much of the transition relevant literature limits its accessibility by stakeholders outside academia. We seek to address these challenges through the development of a transdisciplinary Transformation Process Framework for use as a 'knowledge integration' tool as part of a co design process for transformative change. The Framework: (1) develops a systematic narrative of the transformational changes that need to be triggered at multiple scales (from individual to society), (2) generates a map to identify key variables, drivers, and blockers in a transformation process integrating different knowledge from fragmented disciplines; (3) serves as a tool to support the exploration of relevant academic (and other) literature to collate and utilise relevant knowledge.

TI  - Towards sustainable business models with a novel life cycle assessment method
T2  - BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Business model (BM) innovation for sustainability is hampered by a lack of tools for environmental assessment and guidance at the BM level. Conventional life cycle assessment (LCA) neglects the economic and socio-technical mechanisms within a BM, and tools based on the BM canvas (BMC) cannot provide recommendations substantiated by environmental data. Here, a new method, BM-LCA, is applied to a case comparing the selling and renting of jackets, using profit as basis of comparison. Results identify how business parameters influence environmental performance, permitting analysis for decoupling within a business practice. This is made possible by the unique way the method links physical life cycle and the monetary flows of a BM. Usefulness of BM-LCA is discussed relative to BM innovation, business strategy and similar tools. BM-LCA provides insights into a broad range of BM elements and emerges as useful for business strategy. By measuring BM environmental performance, it helps determine what BM to compete with and support critical analysis of business against greenwashing. BM-LCA also enables identification of BM elements in greatest need of environmental innovation. BM-LCA appears as a promising tool for guiding business companies towards sustainability, filling a space between LCA and BMC. The method offers a practical way for business and LCA experts to merge their respective knowledge.

TI  - Beyond technology: A research agenda for social sciences and humanities research on renewable energy in Europe
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article enriches the existing literature on the importance and role of the social sciences and humanities (SSH) in renewable energy sources research by providing a novel approach to instigating the future research agenda in this field. Employing a series of in-depth interviews, deliberative focus group workshops and a systematic horizon scanning process, which utilised the expert knowledge of 85 researchers from the field with diverse disciplinary backgrounds and expertise, the paper develops a set of 100 priority questions for future research within SSH scholarship on renewable energy sources. These questions were aggregated into four main directions: (i) deep transformations and connections to the broader economic system (i.e. radical ways of (re) arranging socio-technical, political and economic relations), (ii) cultural and geographical diversity (i.e. contextual cultural, historical, political and socio-economic factors influencing citizen support for energy transitions), (iii) complexifying energy governance (i.e. understanding energy systems from a systems dynamics perspective) and (iv) shifting from instrumental acceptance to value-based objectives (i.e. public support for energy transitions as a normative notion linked to trust-building and citizen engagement). While this agenda is not intended to be-and cannot be-exhaustive or exclusive, we argue that it advances the understanding of SSH research on renewable energy sources and may have important value in the prioritisation of SSH themes needed to enrich dialogues between policymakers, funding institutions and researchers. SSH scholarship should not be treated as instrumental to other research on renewable energy but as intrinsic and of the same hierarchical importance.

TI  - Comparing sustainability transition labs across process, effects and impacts: Insights from Canada and Sweden
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purposeful transformative change on a level of societal systems, structures and practices is called for in response to contemporary sustainability challenges. Sustainability transition labs and arenas represent a particular set of governance innovations seeking to foster systemic change based on deliberate engagement of multiple actors around complex issues of concern. Most labs aim for long-term contributions in addressing persistent societal challenges and transitioning into sustainability, yet are seldomly evaluated on whether, how and to what extents such contributions become realised in practice. In this paper, we further an analytical framework for comparatively analysing sustainability transition labs and arenas with emphasis on their processes, effects and impacts. The framework is applied on two cases: Energy Futures Lab initiated in Alberta, Canada and the arenas for a Fossil Independent West Sweden -Climate 2030. In particular, the comparison showcases how contextual difference in terms of urgency and turbulence may influence lab activities and how ownership and governance conditions may influence the various directions outputs, effects and wider impacts took. The comparison further illuminates how backcasting and the multi-level perspective may serve as complementary frameworks and tools in lab processes, whose respective role may depend on aspiration and context. We end the paper by providing a series of key considerations in furthering the comparative analytical framework and its application in practice. They orient around the three guiding questions on the why's, what's, and how's of doing comparative research on sustainability transition arenas and labs across their processes, effects and impacts.

TI  - The Role of Consumer-Citizens and Connectedness to Nature in the Sustainable Transition to Agroecological Food Systems: The Mediation of Innovative Business Models and a Multi-Level Perspective
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Conventional agricultural systems have contributed to social, economic and environmental problems and are the main threat to global sustainability. In response, theoretical frameworks to describe the transition to sustainable food systems have been proposed, emphasizing the necessity to shift from farm-level solutions to a focus on interactions within the entire value chain, from production to consumption. Despite the emphasis on the importance and potential of consumers to contribute to sustainable agri-food transitions, approaches to their role have remained within the traditional, linear supply chain framework. Marketing approaches view consumers as passive actors, limited to voting with their wallets, which has deepened the disconnection between consumers, producers and nature, resulting in a triple fracture. We analyze the role of the consumer in agri-food systems, contrasting marketing approaches with other consumers/citizens concepts and locate them within sustainability transition frameworks and a multi-level perspective. We discuss the re-establishment of the connection between farmers and consumers and human-nature connectedness and explore this connection mediated through innovative business models, which act as niche innovations with the capacity to influence regimes and landscapes within the multi-level perspective. The role of consumers/citizens in the co-creation of innovative business models is also addressed.

TI  - The Butterfly Framework for the Assessment of Transitions towards a Circular and Climate Neutral Society
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Butterfly framework of Wageningen University & Research (WUR) for assessing transitions towards a circular and climate-neutral society is presented. The Butterfly framework is built after analysis of existing frameworks that could only partly comply with the needs of the full set of stakeholders interlinked and operating in domains like society and well-being; food, feed, and biobased production; natural resources and living environment. It shows that for adequate action perspectives on and in these domains, the socio-ecological, socio-technical, and socio-institutional subsystems should be fully integrated, and stakeholders should be equally consulted and appreciated. In order to advance and integrate action perspectives of different stakeholders in the light of the transition to circularity with high-level ambitions like climate neutrality, stakeholders (groups) need to understand their position and links in a full systems perspective, which the Butterfly framework provides.

TI  - Sustainable market transformation: A refined framework for analyzing causal loops in transitions to sustainability
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article proposes a refined conceptual framework to understand and act upon sustainable market transformation processes. Currently, there is a knowledge gap between government oriented approaches to transition management and market formation that is addressed in evolutionary economics. Consequently, this article builds upon literature in the field of evolutionary economics, systems theory and transition management, to conceptualize the causal loops which trigger collective behavior facing sustainability issues. Furthermore, it proposes how these causal loops can be altered by interventions of actors in four sequential transition phases and illustrates what kind of interventions are most effective to accelerate a sustainable market transformation process. Promising avenues for future empirical studies based on the suggested conceptual framework, are the investigation of how the concepts of sustainable market transformation are applied in different market contexts and the evaluation of whether the applied interventions actually alter the underlying causal loops.

TI  - Governing agricultural innovation: A comprehensive framework to underpin sustainable transitions
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Innovations have the potential to help us address and overcome many of the challenges that agriculture is facing today. Yet, at the same time, they have the potential to create new, sometimes even more challenging, problems, especially when they are not governed in a sustainable way. Governing agricultural innovation sustainably requires understanding of all components that influence, and are influenced by, innovation processes, interactions across societal levels, and the normative and power dynamics that come together to shape the direction and outcomes of innovation processes. Hitherto, approaches to (agricultural) innovation and transition tend to specialize on a specific societal scale or sub-aspect of innovation or transition processes. In this article we aim to bring the strengths of some of the main approaches (Multi-Level Perspective, Agricultural Innovation Systems, Responsible Innovation, Innovation Management, Theory of Planned Behaviour) and insights from environmental governance literature together into a comprehensive framework. The framework describes seven key components and their interactions: macro context, governance system, immediate context, innovative and adaptive capacity of the actors, psychosocial factors, and the innovation process itself. Based on these, we present a subset of guiding questions that can be used diagnostically or for design purposes to support the sustainable governance of agricultural innovation processes.

TI  - A typology for unpacking the diversity of social innovation in energy transitions
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Academic research and policy have focused on sustainable energy transitions for addressing the societal chal-lenge of climate change for a long time, but the concept of 'social innovation' has only been recently taken up. This concept refers to different social phenomena relating to changes in socio-technical systems. Moving beyond narrow perspectives on social innovation, this article asks how we can capture the diversity of social innovation, taking the example of the energy sector. It proposes a comprehensive typology of social innovation that allows to capture the phenomenon in its empirical diversity, and to more systematically investigate processes of social innovation and their contributions to making socio-technical systems more sustainable. The typology is based on a conceptual understanding of social innovation in energy (SIE) as comprising changing social relations involving new ways of doing, thinking and/or organising energy. It is empirically grounded in mapping and analysing 500 SIE-initiatives across eight European countries. Such a conceptually-informed and empirically-grounded un-derstanding of SIE sheds light on the 'social' as an object of innovation, the agency of a multitude of actors, and the different types of social relations and activities pursued by energy system actors. It also opens the possibility to publicly discuss the diverse social innovations and their interdependencies, (un)desirability, as well as transformative potentials in energy transitions.

TI  - Unveiling the political economy of fossil fuel extractivism in Colombia: Tracing the processes of phase-in, entrenchment, and lock-in
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - To increase the ambition and effectiveness of a global coal phase-out, it is central to understand how one extraction regime - fossil fuel extractivism (FE) - was phased in. Doing so may make it possible to confront the actors dependent on and strengthened by the associated natural resource rents. Characterized by the largescale, high-impact, export-oriented extraction of fossil fuels such as steam coal, the present paper traces the processes that led first to the phase-in and then to the entrenchment of FE in Colombia. Taking the case of large-scale coal extraction (LSCE) as an example, the paper analyzes the causal mechanisms allowing this activity to take deep roots in politics, society and the economy, with grave implications for the environment and culture of affected communities and the country as a whole. Drawing on different data sources (20 stakeholder interviews, policy and press documents, scholarly research, etc.), the paper adapted Palley's (2017) notion of policy lock-in and lock-out via hysteresis to propose an entrenchment spiral as a potential mechanism leading to the current degree of coal and fossil fuel extraction entrenchment in Colombia. The paper concludes that the phase-in of LSCE and FE was facilitated by the combination of masking and securitization strategies used by an incumbency regime closely associated with state capture. As power dynamics shifted, asymmetric dependency relationships between mining companies and affected individuals, communities and governments at local, regional and national levels were gradually generated, leading to this sector's seemingly inexpugnable position. That said, knowledge is power. Knowing how phase-in and entrenchment occurred and still happens can be an initial step towards confronting and even reversing it.

TI  - An actionable understanding of societal transitions: the X-curve framework
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainability transition research seeks to understand the patterns and dynamics of structural societal change as well as unearth strategies for governance. However, existing frameworks emphasize innovation and build-up over exnovation and break-down. This limits their potential in making sense of the turbulent and chaotic dynamics of current transition-in-the-making. Addressing this gap, our paper elaborates on the development and use of the X-curve framework. The X-curve provides a simplified depiction of transitions that explicitly captures the patterns of build-up, breakdown, and their interactions. Using three cases, we illustrate the X-curve's main strength as a framework that can support groups of people to develop a shared understanding of the dynamics in transitions-in-the-making. This helps them reflect upon their roles, potential influence, and the needed capacities for desired transitions. We discuss some challenges in using the X-curve framework, such as participants' grasp of 'chaos', and provide suggestions on how to address these challenges and strengthen the frameworks' ability to support understanding and navigation of transition dynamics. We conclude by summarizing its main strength and invite the reader to use it, reflect on it, build on it, and judge its value for action research on sustainability transitions themselves.

TI  - Democratising sustainability transformations: Assessing the transformative potential of democratic practices in environmental governance
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Many democracies find it difficult to act swiftly on problems such as climate change and biodiversity loss. This is reflected in long-standing debates in research and policy about whether democratic practices are capable of fostering timely, large-scale transformations towards sustainability. Drawing on an integrative review of scholarly literature from 2011 to early 2021 on sustainability transformations and the democracy-environment nexus, this article synthesises existing research on prospects and pitfalls for democratising sustainability transformations. We advance a new typology for understanding various combinations of democratic/authoritarian practices and of transformations towards/away from sustainability. We then explore the role of democratic practices in accelerating or obstructing five key dimensions of sustainability transformations: institutional, social, economic, technological, and epistemic. Across all dimensions we find substantial evidence that democratic practices can foster transformations towards sustainability, and we conclude by outlining a set of associated policy recommendations.

TI  - Biting the bullet: Addressing the democratic legitimacy of transition management
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - From early on, reflexive governance approaches have been problematised for lacking explicit consideration of formal governance and decision-making structures. Developed over two decades ago, transition management is not an exception; it has been specifically critiqued for being democratically illegitimate and depoliticising issues. Contributing to these debates, this article develops a legitimacy framework for understanding how transition management practices can be legitimised within liberal democratic structures, while safeguarding their transformative potential, or, 'radical core', while navigating innovation capture. This framework guides a comparative analysis of six European cities, who employ transition management practices for developing decarbonisation roadmaps towards 2050. We discuss the emphasis on liberal democratic norms, the fuzziness of practices of participation and the closing down of policy options. We recommend the legitimacy framework to be used as a heuristic for reflexive governance, tool for explicating the conditionality of 'radicality' in transition management, and guide for designing accountability governance structures.

TI  - Mapping emergent public engagement in societal transitions: a scoping review
T2  - ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Transition discourses are gaining prominence in efforts to imagine a future that adequately addresses the urgent need to establish low carbon and climate resilient pathways. Within these discourses the 'public' is seen as central to the creation and implementation of appropriate interventions. The role of public engagement in societal transformation while essential, is also complex and often poorly understood. The purpose of this paper is to enhance our understanding regarding public engagement and to address the often superficial and shallow policy discourse on this topic. Main text The paper offers a review of evolving literature to map emergent public engagement in processes of transition and change. We adopt a pragmatic approach towards literature retrieval and analysis which enables a cross-disciplinary and cross-sectoral review. We use a scoping review process and the three spheres of transformation framework (designated as the practical, political and personal spheres) to explore trends within this complex research field. The review draws from literature from the last two decades in the Irish context and looks at emergence and evolving spaces of public engagement within various systems of change including energy, food, coastal management and flood adaptation, among others. Conclusions The results highlight the siloed and fragmented way in which public engagement in transitions is carried and we propose a more cross-sectoral and cross-disciplinary approach which depends on bringing into dialogue often contrasting theories and perspectives. The paper also illustrates some shifting engagement approaches. For instance, nexus articles between the practical and political spheres suggest deeper forms of public engagement beyond aggregated consumer behaviour to align technological delivery with institutional and societal contexts. While most articles in the practical sphere draw largely on techno-economic insights this influence and cross-disciplinarity is likely to draw in further innovations. Nexus articles between the political and personal sphere are also drawing on shifting ideas of public engagement and largely stress the need to disrupt reductive notions of engagement and agency within our institutions. Many of these articles call attention to problems with top-down public engagement structures and in various ways show how they often undermine and marginalise different groups.

T2  - CUADERNOS DEL CLAEH-CENTRO LATINOAMERICANO DE ECONOMIA HUMANA
M3  - Article
AB  - We are going through times of ecological crisis, inequality crisis, but also a crisis of confidence in government, politics and science. In this context, today's societies are challenged to move towards a sustainable transition, by building a more just and egalitarian coexistence model in the region. Various academic circles, centers of strategic analysis and development, as well as political activists, have argued in favor of transforming governance models, the social contract, as well as the interactions within and between society, economy and government, based on new values and imaginaries which would enable to move from a market society to more sustainable alternatives, towards greater social equity and well-being. Reflecting on new governance models is therefore a global challenge which, in this regional context, focuses on sustainable transition processes. This article explores conceptual framings on environmental governance and possible virtuous interactions between the various contributions and approaches, in order to robustly incorporate political dynamics into change processes.

TI  - The Concept of Adaptation
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Adaptation (i.e., actions that reduce the harms caused by climate change) is widely recognized as one of two pillars of climate action, along with mitigation (i.e., actions that reduce the concentrations of greenhouse gases which cause climate change). Action to date in both pillars is widely recognized as insufficient. This article argues that a major source of this deficiency of adaptation is ambiguity in the concept of adaptation, which hinders planning and implementation of action. The review traces the origins and consequences of this ambiguity and examines three major conceptual obstacles: the unclear relationship between adaptation and mitigation, the tendency to define adaptation by listing distinct types that are not directly comparable and hence difficult to measure, and a persistent separation of short-term and long-term perspectives that limits the ability to build from current action to transformation. The article identifies recent efforts that have addressed these obstacles, although new areas of concern have emerged, particularly maladaptation and Loss and Damage.

TI  - Investigations into the transition toward an established e-waste management system in China: Empirical evidence from Guangdong and Shaanxi
T2  - CURRENT RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - China not only is the largest generator of electrical and electronic waste (e-waste) in the world but is among the countries affected the most by previous importation and informal recycling. In this paper, we explore how the implementation of policies has impacted a transition toward an established e-waste management system. We combine a brief review of the main advancements of e-waste management legislation in the country with field observations at two e-waste recycling sites. Informed by transition management, we investigate interconnections between the informal and formal sectors, and motivations to focus on certain appliances. Our findings suggest that the strongest drivers of change toward sustainability transitions are external, such as legislation and market. The remaining challenges include policy gaps for specific appliances and the disconnection between policies and the informal sector. This study provides scientific insights into transition possibilities for more established e -waste practices and contributes to advancements toward a circular economy.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th International Conference on Interactive Collaborative Learning (ICL) / 50th IGIP International Conference on Engineering Pedagogy
CL  - Dresden, GERMANY
AB  - In this paper, we argue that the important contribution of modern entrepreneurs is not only related to business aims, but also to dealing with complex societal real-world challenges in a systemic, creative, and future-oriented manner. Thus, entrepreneurship is beyond the simplified idea to develop a concept of a business model, but to understand it as a driver for societal change. For that, creativity and systemic approaches are becoming important factors for entrepreneurial thinking, which is geared towards necessary sustainable and future-oriented impacts. What are the necessary competences for entrepreneurs to innovate such new enriched business models, which are embedded in societal changes? We outline the needs for particular educational methods and means that allow for a deeper complex system understanding. We consider system thinking and analysis, problem structuring, co-creation of ideas and improvisation, as well as scenario development tools as means for the empowerment of future entrepreneurs. Sustainable businesses in the long-term perspective (based on the understanding of various time- and agent boundaries), as well as capabilities to respond to emerging unintended effects (e.g., positive and negative side effects of digital transformations) are aimed to be a core focus of such an empowerment.

TI  - Bringing Transition Management to Cities: Building Skills for Transformative Urban Governance
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities are open to trialing new approaches for advancing their planning and urban governance practice. Evidence from urban research and practice shows that transition management has been widely and diversely applied for strategic planning for climate mitigation and adaptation, regeneration, as well as sectoral (energy, water, waste) and social cohesion agendas. Despite the amounting evidence of the applications of transition management, the research has not identified what it is required in terms of skills to apply such a governance framework for participatory governance in cities. In this paper, we respond to this gap by providing evidence from 11 cities across Europe that applied transition management as an approach to participatory urban governance for unpacking what transformative actions are required to strengthen urban resilience in deprived neighborhoods. Our multi-case study research and analysis reveals that a multitude of vocational and academic skills are required for the application of transition management approach including systems thinking, creativity, theory-to-practice application skills, diplomatic skills for forging partnerships and learning alliances and openness to learning-by-doing during experimentation. Transition management application in cities in the Resilient Europe project brought about positive outcomes in terms of developing new skills, embedding new knowledge about urban resilience and transition management in planning.

TI  - Realities of Using Drones to Transport Laboratory Samples: Insights from Attended Routes in a Mixed-Methods Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY HEALTHCARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Drones are an emerging technology with the potential to improve laboratory logistics. This study is based on the hypothesis that the implementation of drones will benefit from an understanding of the current system and that existing transport solutions should be optimized before drone solutions are considered. It focuses on carriers transporting biological material today by car along a traditional circular route. It aims to explore how the current transport service is organized, identify areas for improvement, and investigate carriers' perceptions of how drones could be integrated into or substituted for their services.Methods: A mixed-methods approach was applied, combining a questionnaire, shadowing of nine transport trips, semi-structured interviews, and time assessments.Results: The carriers shared insights into how to optimize existing transport solutions in terms of structure, culture, attitudes, and overall functionality. Most carriers expressed in the questionnaire that they were little involved in innovation work. The time assessment revealed that not the driving times, but the loading times had the highest deviations from plans and thus represented the area with the greatest potential for simple improvements. Questions about the use and organizational impact of drones are generated, and their prospects are discussed from a broad sociotechnical perspective.Conclusion: Our concept was to broaden our understanding of implementing drones into existing systems in a fairly simple setting. Although improved logistics may take place without complex processes, future research opportunities such as the impact of drones on organizational processes and social dynamics in the adoption of drones may be needed if more complex systems are involved. The paper proposes experimenting with, and learning from, transport with "road vehicles" and drones in combination and suggests that improvements should be made to existing transport solutions before drones are implemented.

TI  - Transitioning to electrified, automated and shared mobility in an African context: A comparative review of Johannesburg, Kigali, Lagos and Nairobi
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Review
AB  - This article focuses on the drivers and barriers afforded by three innovations-automated vehicles, electric mobility, and ridesharing and bike-sharing-in the four African urban areas of Johannesburg (South Africa), Kigali (Rwanda), Lagos (Nigeria) and Nairobi (Kenya). We ask: what are the drivers behind these innovations in these regions? What are the potential barriers? And what implications for policy or sustainability transitions emerge? Based on a review of the academic literature, we argue that these innovations are particularly important at providing low-carbon transitions for the transport sector, even though low-carbon development is an important topic that is under-researched in many developing economies. We begin by introducing these three innovations and justifying our four case studies. We base the research design on an interdisciplinary critical and umbrella literature review. We then discuss the results of our review, which is organized as a dualism of positive drivers and negative barriers, before discussing how to better harness innovation for low-carbon mobility in an African context. We find that the possible benefits of our three innovations exist only juxtaposed against negative barriers; no innovation is purely positive or negative and all of them have multiple dimensions of positivity and negativity. Although we have treated each of the three innovations as fairly isolated from one another, there are emergent (and potentially strong) couplings or entanglements between them, e.g. between electrification and two-wheelers or automation and ridesharing. In some contexts, hybridization, incrementalism and leapfrogging are seen as positive attributes and desirable characteristics of planning and technology adoption.

TI  - The challenges of co-research in labs in real-world contexts: empirical findings from four labs in the context of urban climate-change research
T2  - TOWN PLANNING REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This article gives insight into two research projects dealing with urban climate change that used laboratories in real-world contexts as a research mode. The article's objective is to investigate the challenges we experienced based on a reflective comparison of the projects' labs. Challenges occurred regarding the lab's core elements, i.e. real-world experiments, the cooperation of scientists and practitioners (transdisciplinarity), the intervention methods (transformation-oriented research), and long-term character and transferability. We suggest that promoting constant communication and reflection, downscaling scope, accepting failure and going beyond the limiting conditions of scientific research may advance the concept of laboratories in real-world contexts.

TI  - Unlocking the potential of gaming for anticipatory governance
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Games offer unique possibilities for imagining and experimenting with new systems of governance for more sustainable futures - new rules and institutions, new roles, and new dynamic worlds. However, research on sustainability games has mostly investigated games as a type of futures method, largely divorced from its societal contexts. In this paper, we argue that to unlock the potential of gaming for anticipatory governance in the service of a more sustainable future, it is important take a whole-society perspective, and examine the possibilities and challenges offered by contextual factors. Using the Netherlands and Japan as examples, we investigate the following questions: 1) How do governance cultures allow or restrict opportunities for the participatory exploration of futures using games? 2) How does, and can, the game sector in a given context support anticipatory gaming? 3) How do dominant societal relationships with games limit, and offer opportunities for, gaming for anticipatory governance?

AB  - This paper inquiries into the role of place in shaping urban transformative capacity to advance urban sustainability transitions. The urban transformative capacity notion developed by Wolfram (2016) provides us with a holistic framework to reconceptualize and address the specific contextual conditions that become relevant in a city to advance path-deviant changes towards sustainability. By comparing the energy and agri-food socio-technical systems in the city of Vale`ncia (Spain), insights have been gained into key contextual factors shaping urban transformative capacity; specifically, the previous local historical trajectories regarding each sociotechnical system, the role of local social movements and local government as articulator of the different components of the framework. Additionally, the way different accounts of sustainability coexist and the interaction between different socio-technical systems at urban level appear as critical issues.

TI  - Bold ambition, blunted agency? Examining top management perspectives on a circular economy transition in Finland
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Y The circular economy is proposed as a company-driven means to further sustainability transitions. Top managers have a critical role in fostering the circular economy as they are responsible for shaping and implementing a company's sustainability strategy and performance. In this paper, we adopt a microfoundations perspective to enhance our understanding of the influence of top managers as agents of the sustainability transition to the circular economy. In a qualitative research study, we interviewed 34 top managers of Finnish companies that are actively pursuing the circular economy. The main implication of our study is in exploring the role of top managers, as they engage in actively structuring a new, circular regime. To this end, our paper provides salient insights into the prevailing debate on the structure-agency question in the sustainability transitions literature. We find that power is a key characteristic of how top managers exercise their agency. Our findings imply that while top managers are perceived as the most powerful members of a company, their agency is often limited by structural constraints on multiple levels within their companies, in the industry, and in the broader regime. Furthermore, we find that top managers' power and agency towards the transition is heavily dependent on their abilities to secure business profitability.

TI  - Exploring the transformative potential of urban food
T2  - NPJ URBAN SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban food is a key lever for transformative change towards sustainability. While research reporting on the urban food practices (UFPs) in support of sustainability is increasing, the link towards transformative potential is lacking. This is because research on urban food is often place-based and contextual. This limits the applicability of insights to large-scale sustainability transformations. This paper describes UFPs that aim to contribute to transformative change. We present signposts for potential change based on the types of intended transformative changes as described in the reviewed literature based on the processes and outcomes of the urban food policies and programmes. Secondly, we classify diverse UFPs to elevate them beyond their local, place-based contexts. We find that UFPs carry a lot of potential to facilitate sustainability transformations. Based on that analysis, we provide insights on how urban food research can further contribute to harnessing the transformative potential of UFPs for actionable purposes.

TI  - Drivers of ethanol fuel development in Brazil: a sociotechnical review
T2  - MRS ENERGY & SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - The development of ethanol as a vehicle fuel in Brazil is the result of a historical trajectory shaped by the interaction of several societal and technological elements. This article addresses this relationship from the perspective of sociotechnical systems, by framing how each sociotechnical element (actors, exogenous shocks, infrastructure, knowledge, social institutions and technologies) enabled the consolidation of ethanol as a fuel alternative to gasoline in Brazil. The section dedicated to institutional change provides a historical overview emphasizing institutional arrangements aimed toward ethanol fuel specifically, as well as an updated review of formal incentive mechanisms. To discuss the expertise system, we analyze the role of private and public actors of research and development (R&D) related with ethanol fuel. We also provide a summary table of the associated sociotechnical elements for researchers interested in applying the sociotechnical transitions framework in the context of biofuels. This article suggests that the strengthening of the sociotechnical system has enabled flexible-fuel vehicles to reach over 70% of the Brazilian light vehicle fleet since their introduction in 2003, a threshold that may indicate an energy transition if changes in fleets, instead of new vehicle sales, are accounted for as an energy transition by itself.

TI  - Remaking political institutions in sustainability transitions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - A key challenge for sustainability transitions scholarship in the coming decade is to understand how existing political institutions (e.g. policies, laws, regulations, constitutions) can be remade to support transitions. This requires not only explaining past changes, but also 'thinking forward' about the types of struggles likely to occur when institutional changes are deliberately pursued. Several areas of struggle come into view: the politics of novelty, uptake, dismantling, stability, and interplay across regimes. This leads to a view of institutional transformation as an unfolding trajectory 'in-the-making', characterized by emergent path creation. Moreover, it enables new bridges from transitions thinking to broader political and policy sciences which also increasingly puzzle over how major societal change may be realized in contemporary society.

TI  - Social enterprises towards a sustainable business system: A model of institutional dynamics
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the growing interest of sustainability transition studies on the role of business actors in shaping transitions, the institutionalized logic of the capitalist enterprise underlying such agency has been overlooked. However, such logic might be understood as a dominant regime that leads to unsustainable systems. We intend to contribute to transitions research by focusing on the agency of social enterprises as non-dominant actors searching for challenging and transforming the institutionalized logics in the business system. Therefore, we disentangle the institutional mechanisms driven by social enterprises by proposing a theoretical model built upon a literature review of sustainability transitions from institutional perspectives, offering a set of explanatory propositions to allow empirical examination. Those mechanisms and propositions operate at three levels: inside the individual, inside the niche, and at the interplay between the niche and the business regime. Finally, we include a real-world example of a social enterprise to illustrate the model.

TI  - 'Holding Properties Vacant Is Resource Stupidity': Towards a Typology of Roles in the (Inter)mediation of Urban 'Temporary Use'
T2  - PLANNING PRACTICE AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - 'Mediators' are becoming recognized as necessary actors in managing complex socio-political dynamics in the 'temporary use' of vacant spaces. However, 'mediation' remains understudied and undertheorized in temporary use scholarship. To better articulate mediator roles in temporary use, I review literature on related 'intermediary' roles in 'urban transitions' literature vis-a-vis temporary use practice. Thereby, I propose a typology of roles in (inter)mediation and elucidate selected roles in practice. By articulating how mediators align interests, build networks and negotiate the conditions in planning and development, this article draws attention to changing professional roles in planning and sets a basis for future research.

TI  - From Djerba to Glasgow: have declarations on tourism and climate change brought us any closer to meaningful climate action?
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM
M3  - Article
AB  - The United Nations has declared climate change a code-red for humanity and the 2020s the decisive decade to avoid dangerous climate disruption. The 26(th) Conference of the Parties in Glasgow, Scotland represents a milestone event and potentially the last chance to keep the Paris Climate Agreement 1.5 degrees C policy goal within reach. The tourism sector has responded to this critical moment by releasing the Glasgow Declaration: A Commitment to a Decade of Tourism Climate Action. As the third such declaration over 20 years, this paper asks whether it brings the sector closer to an action agenda commensurate with the climate emergency the sector has declared. While the Glasgow Declaration includes some positive advances, we find few themes and recommended actions that were not introduced in previous declarations over a decade ago and inaction on several past recommendations. There is no evidence that the declarations have altered the growth trajectory of sector emissions or influenced the integration of climate change into tourism policy and planning. The climate crisis demands a sectoral response no less than that to the Covid-19 pandemic, and we find the Glasgow Declaration ill-equipped to stimulate the systemic change required by the net-zero transition and accelerating changes in climate.

TI  - Towards a multi-scalar and multi-horizon framework of energy injustice: A whole systems analysis of Estonian energy transition
T2  - POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The shift from carbon-intensive to low-carbon energy systems has profound justice implications as some regions are likely to lose as much as gain from decarbonization processes. Increasing calls have been made to adopt a 'whole systems' perspective on energy justice. Drawing on the Multi-level Perspective on socio-technical transitions this paper presents a new comprehensive framework of energy justice in system innovation, proposing to map injustices along three dimensions: 1) multiple spatial scales (regional, national, international); 2) different time horizons (currently experienced vs. anticipated injustices); 3) connections to transition dynamics (injustices related to the optimization of the currently dominant system, destabilization of the incumbent system or the acceleration of alternative solutions in niches). The framework is applied to analyse the ongoing energy transition in Estonia, involving interactions between the incumbent oil shale based regime and wind, solar, nuclear and bioenergy as emerging niche challengers. The content analysis of news items in Estonian media reveals an inventory of 214 distinct incidents of energy injustices across 21 different categories. We find that many experienced and anticipated injustices are deployed, often strategically, by certain actors to advocate specific energy futures and to influence current political choices. From the justice perspective our analysis thus raises a question whether it is ethical to use probable yet currently unrealized injustices related to regime destabilization and niche acceleration as a means to perpetuate injustices related to the optimization of the currently dominant regime.

TI  - The socio-political context of energy storage transition: Insights from a media analysis of Chinese newspapers
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of energy storage (ES) technology is essential for a sustainable energy transition; however, the socio-political context of ES tends to make its large-scale development challenging, which requires more attention. Given the role of media discourse in both reflecting and influencing such socio-technical processes, we initially analysed the national media representation of ES in China based on the Socio-Political Evaluation of Energy Deployment (SPEED) framework. We did this by analysing 156 ES-related articles from two Chinese mainstream newspapers, People's Daily and China Daily. Through investigating the framing and frequency of articles, the particular ES technology mentioned, and the stakeholders involved, we identify (1) a generally promising pathway of ES development due to its transformative role in China's low-carbon energy transition and its alignments with other national priorities and interests; (2) some uncertainties about ES development regarding local institutional inertia and how people interact with ES technologies, which could hinder an ES transition; and (3) domestic complexity and dynamics underpinning ES technologies, reflecting a supportive attitude of the Chinese government and a top-down governance system. Our findings help to uncover the unique socio-political environment around ES in China, how audiences are informed, and the support provided to stakeholders' strategies.

TI  - Transition Design in Latin America: Enabling Collective Learning and Change
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SOCIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Latin American societies currently confront numerous social, economic, and environmental issues. The complex and interlinked nature of these issues demands responses that fully and equally engage with the social and environmental domains in creative and integrative ways that blur traditional dichotomies and disciplinary boundaries. Most importantly, they need to weave in and reflect the plurality and specificity of the contexts in an autonomous and non-colonialist fashion. In this paper, we draw inspiration from approaches that emerged in the Global North such as Resilience Thinking, Policy Design, and Transition Design, all of which strive for knowledge plurality and synthesis applied to systemic transformational processes. To contribute to this pluralistic motivation and to promote critical reflection and learning, in this work we outline the main contributions of such approaches and have them converse with Latin American perspectives and practices. Through the application of a Transition Design lens, a practice-oriented perspective aimed at catalyzing societal transitional processes towards sustainable futures, we act as practitioners and interlocutors that adopt, adapt, and expand its theoretical and methodological applications in collective learning spaces, processes, and platforms. The action-oriented nature of this approach allows us to analyze particular cases of application, their contexts, and their theoretical or methodological nuances which determine their potential or degree of success in generating actual change. The structure of this article moves from outlining and introducing the main frameworks and notions relevant for adopting a Transition Design approach in Latin America, to describing cases developed in different pedagogical or action-research platforms, culminating with a collection of reflections stemming from our experiences applying Transition Design in Latin America. The first section offers a theoretical compass to expand a more robust framework that supports and enables socio-environmental transitions in the region. The second part presents three case studies to illustrate the application and interpretation of different methods and the challenges and opportunities presented. We conclude by offering insights into potential future pathways for embracing and deepening holistic and systemic approaches like Transition Design in Latin American settings.

TI  - Transition Pathways for the Farmed Salmon Value Chain: Industry Perspectives and Sustainability Implications
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Salmon is the most consumed farmed seafood in the EU and there is no indication that demand will abate. Yet salmon aquaculture's environmental impacts are significant, and its future is likely to be shaped by demands of increased but at the same time more sustainable production. This study developed an integrated theoretical framework based on the multi-level perspective (MLP) and a global value chain (GVC) governance framework and applied it to the global farmed salmon value chain. The objective was to provide insights on the most likely transition pathway towards sustainability based on industry and expert perspectives. The perceptions on challenges and drivers of change, were gathered through focus groups and in-depth interviews, and fitted to the integrated framework to facilitate the transition pathway analysis. Viewing the qualitative findings in the context of the MLP framework provided information about the current workings of the system, the drivers of change in the socio-technical landscape and niche-innovations and their potential to challenge or enhance the current system and thus indicated possible system transitions. To emphasize the role of industry actors in shaping the future of the salmon value chain, the analysis was strengthened using the GVC model which added information about power relations, signaling the ability of system actors to motivate or resist change. The findings indicate that, due to resistance in the regime and the fact that niche-innovations are not yet sufficiently developed, the farmed salmon value chain will continue to be predominated by traditional sea-based aquaculture but that there will be a gradual shift towards more diversity in terms of production methods in response to landscape pressures. The discussion addresses sustainability challenges and policy implications for the farmed salmon value chain and highlights the need for a food system perspective.

TI  - Social Obstetrics as Niche-Development in Addressing Health Inequities
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - We apply a transition research perspective to the Dutch obstetric care system to analyze historic, current, and future shifts and find ways to overcome persistent health inequities. We present social obstetrics as an emerging niche that addresses perinatal health inequities by acknowledging their multifaceted origins and fostering collaborations across the medical, social, and public health sectors. We conducted desk research, in-depth semi-structured expert interviews, and interactive group sessions with change-inclined professionals that are relevant for the implementation of social obstetrics in six Dutch municipalities. The outcomes are synthesized in a historical narrative and perspectives on current obstacles and future systemic shifts. We argue that social obstetrics can be considered a sustainable addition to what is already present, instead of a disruptive transformation of the current system. Social obstetrics is innovative as it connects various societal systems and offers a framework for cross-sectoral collaboration. These collaborations, in turn, can be the starting point for the transformation of the obstetric care system as well as other relevant societal systems.

TI  - Effects and Interactions of Researcher's Motivation and Personality in Promoting Interdisciplinary and Transdisciplinary Research
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Motivation is one of the most important factors driving innovative activities such as interdisciplinary research (IDR) and transdisciplinary research (TDR) for the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs). While there has been progress in developing ex-post indicators to evaluate their performance, only a few trials have been conducted to explore how researchers' motivations are related to their proactive participation. To address this issue, this study empirically investigates the effect of researchers' personality traits on their attitudes toward IDR/TDR collaboration. A questionnaire survey of 228 researchers in the natural sciences, mathematics, engineering, and related interdisciplinary fields was used to test the hypotheses by regression analysis that included interaction terms. The results show that researchers' intrinsic motivation positively affects both IDR and TDR, while their extrinsic motivation mainly affects TDR. Furthermore, researchers' personality traits have a significant effect on interdisciplinary collaboration and regional/societal collaboration. These findings provide cues on how to effectively integrate knowledge of IDR/TDR and how to motivate and allocate researchers for successful TDR/IDR collaboration.

TI  - Where is our delivery? The political and socio-technical roadblocks to decarbonising United Kingdom road freight
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Road freight represents approximately 8.5% of UK carbon emissions and therefore must be abated if the UK government's objective to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 is to be achieved. While several technology options exist, it is commonly viewed as a hard-to-abate sector and progress to decarbonisation remains slow.Whereas techno-economic aspects of the low carbon transition of road freight are well studied, socio-technical and political aspects are much less so. This is in contrast with substantial socio-technical literature focused on the transition of passenger vehicles. Symptomatic of this, there is little direct engagement in research with freight industry operators and participants. This study seeks to address these gaps by considering the views of these key actors through qualitative social science research.Fifteen semi-structured interviews were undertaken with key stakeholders within the road freight industry. These revealed a range of themes and relevant issues which underline the complexity of this transition. Further analysis of the data revealed six overarching viewpoints that reflect the primary concerns of the expert interviewees. These viewpoints suggest that the challenges for the road freight transition are principally political and socio-technical, and opportunities are identified to further explore these through future research.

TI  - Transition to agri-food sustainability, assessing accelerators and triggers for transformation: Case study in Valencia, Spain
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The agri-food regime faces urgent structural and ethical challenges to advance towards sustainability; therefore, the search for triggers, accelerators and supports for sustainability transition is of outstanding scientific and social interest. Valencia's agri-food system is challenging the status quo with creative initiatives, selforganisation and a transformative process in agri-food policy, including local food governance and agroecological transition. Through interpretative research combining qualitative methods, this analysis assesses accelerators and reveals the triggers of this process of change in Valencia's agri-food system. The study uses the Urban Transformative Capacity Framework (UTCF), which has been empirically applied to the agri-food system for the first time, in order to understand its scope and limitations. The case study was contextualised with the MultiLevel Perspective (MLP), which provided temporality and a larger scale view. The merging of frameworks revealed specific triggers and dynamics of the pre-development of capacities for transition, involving different actors and levels, in which empowered social movements and their informal governance spaces play a key role. The ultimate purpose of this study is to contribute to local agri-food transition processes, along with focusing priorities for action, actively involving research in the process.

TI  - Enacting theories of change for food systems transformation under climate change
T2  - GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY-AGRICULTURE POLICY ECONOMICS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past few years, we have seen growing calls for a transformation in global food systems in response to multiple challenges, including climate change. Food systems are responsible for a third of global greenhouse gas emissions from human activity and agricultural yields are at risk due to climate change impacts. Although many proposals have been made, there are fewer insights on what these imply for knowledge and innovation systems. We seek to advance the literature on transforming food systems under a changing climate, by identifying concrete next steps for scientists and practitioners. We do this by adapting a theory of change proposed by Campbell et al. (2018). We used the adapted theory of change to design the 5th Global Science Conference on ClimateSmart Agriculture, which brought together different stakeholders within global food systems. Through conference sessions and a survey with 262 of the participants, we validate elements of the Campbell et al. framework, identify additional elements, and offer further nuance. The findings point at nine priority areas for a transformation in food systems under climate change: (1) Empowering farmer and consumer organizations, women and youth; (2) Digitally enabled climate-informed services; (3) Climate-resilient and low-emission practices and technologies; (4) Innovative finance to leverage public and private sector investments; (5) Reshaping supply chains, food retail, marketing and procurement; (6) Fostering enabling policies and institutions; (7) Knowledge transfer; (8) Addressing fragmentation in the knowledge and innovation systems; (9) Ensuring food security. We have identified three types of scholarly insights from innovation, transition and sustainability transformations studies that may inform the next steps: these relate to stimulating novelty across the priority areas, ensuring participation in knowledge production, and reconfiguring incumbent systems to enable implementation of the theory of change.

TI  - A Rational Policy Design or Contingent Historical Creation? Considering the Emergence of China's Distributed Solar Power Generation Regime
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - How did distributed solar power generation (DSPG) rise to prominence in China? Was there a causal link between China's industrial policies and its achievements in solar photovoltaic (PV)? Drawing on regime research, this article responds to such inquiries by delving deeply into the development course of this sector and thereby illuminating the role of policy 'niches'. Supplementing the dominant structural analyses that account for why industrial policies worked in China, insights generated from a regime analysis provide answers to the crucial question of how this specific industry came about and gained strength within China's governing system. It was found that as carriers of policy directives, demonstration projects functioned as niches and the pertinent fruits generated therein were converged into the constituent ingredients of the new DSPG regime. But, this process owes its success more to fortuity than rationality. A processual analysis focusing on niche and regime shaping sheds light on some latent and nebulous aspects of industrial management in China such as policy legacies, layering, patching, and contingency.

TI  - Crisis, transformation, and agency: Why are people going back-to-the-land in Greece?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Transformations are fundamentally about agency: human intention, motivation, and power to influence and to resist. Most studies focus on deliberate system-level transformations, usually guided by a set of influential actors. However, system-level transformations may also occur as the result of the cascading effects of multiple individual transformations in response or in anticipation to various crises. Little is known about how crises foster these individual transformations, and how these may relate to different types of system-level change. This article fills this gap by looking at how crisis fosters two different types of agencies-internal and external-and how these link to individual transformations in the case of Greece's back-to-the-land movement whereby urbanites sought to reconnect with land-based livelihoods during the economic crisis (2008 onwards). The article draws on the qualitative analysis of 76 interviews of back-to-the-landers to further understand why people are going back-to-the-land (their motivations), how these relate to the concept of agency and individual transformation, and what implications might there be for system-level social-ecological transformations. This article makes three key points. First, crises create different opportunity contexts that may lead to rapid changes in what is valued in the broader social discourse. While social values and discourses are usually considered to be "deep levers" and slow to change, we found that they can rapidly shift in times of crises, challenging notions of the role of fast vs. slow variables in system transformations. Second, agency is needed to respond to crises but is also further catalyzed and enhanced through crisis; activating one's internal agency leads to personal transformations as well as collective transformations (linked to external agency), which are mutually co-constitutive. And third, systemic-level transformation emerges through multiple pathways including through the aggregation of multiple individual transformations that may lead to emergent system-level changes.

TI  - Figuring the Transition from Circular Economy to Circular Society in Australia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The combined pressure of economic, environmental, and social crises, including bushfires, waste management, and COVID created conditions for a turn to the circular economy in Australia. In addition to a dominant circular discourse of ecological modernization in state and federal policy and business and public consultations, other more socially inclusive and ecologically sensitive discourses are circulating. The two main competing discourses are a techcentric circular economy and a reformist circular society, the latter reflected in 'growth agnostic' doughnut economics. In the context of unambitious federal and state policies, the circular transition is being supported by a range of intermediary organizations whose key representatives envision or 'figure' the sustainability transition in hybrid discursive combinations. Few studies of the circular economy transition in Australia exist and none focus on competing discourses and intermediation for sustainability transition. Since intermediary organizations both discursively reflect and lead the circular change, fuller understanding of how circularity is interpreted or 'figured' by key actors is crucial. This study identifies how twenty representatives from intermediating organizations actively 'figure' the process of the circular transition for Australia, including while managing the tension between personal positions and organizational missions. Employing the concept of figured worlds this qualitative thematic discourse interview study analyses how, drawing on available circular discourses, key actors and their organisations actively 'figure' the present and future circular transition. The study contributes to debates on circular discourses, nature, and the limitations of the circular economy in Australia, the relational space of intermediation, and the nature of MLP transitions for a sustainable circular transition economy in Australia.

TI  - Climate change acts non-adoption as potential for renewed expertise and climate activism: the Belgian case
T2  - CLIMATE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - A substantial literature explains the adoption of climate change acts and their impact on climate policy once adopted. In contrast, we know very little about the processes leading to the non-adoption of climate change acts and the subsequent consequences for climate policymaking. This contribution aims at filling this gap by analysing the non-adoption of the Belgian bill for a climate change law. Proposed in February 2019, the Belgian bill for a climate change law was debated but then rejected very soon after, at the end of March 2019. Taking the non-adoption of the Belgian bill on climate change as an enlightening case study, this contribution investigates the impact of climate change act non-adoption on climate policies by: (i) questioning how climate change acts are drafted, and the role of academic experts for such a task in a context of climate emergency; (ii) analysing the reception and discussion of the bill on climate action, including within civil society; and (iii) tracing the follow-up actions undertaken in the wake of the bill's non-adoption. The research relies on documentary analysis (climate change act drafts and final text, parliamentary discussions, non-governmental organizations' archives), interviews with key actors and an exploratory questionnaire with climate activists. Although it was not adopted, we argue that the climate change act project has opened new opportunities to rethink expertise and climate mobilization in Belgium. Key Policy Insights Even when climate change bills fail, they can still have important political or policy effects in the future by raising awareness for the impacts of climate change. When proposing new laws, academic experts should be well informed about the timing and conditions of the political agenda. Consultations with civil society on climate change law projects would increase public awareness and pressure for adoption. Including other important societal causes related to social, economic, decolonial and gender issues, would be key to broadening the impact of the climate movement.

TI  - Cracks in the wall of a car-oriented local mobility system-Results of an urban living lab
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focuses on evaluating the effects of an Urban Living Lab (ULL), which aims to promote the sustainable transition of a local mobility system through civic engagement within a multi-actor cooperation network. For this purpose, an approach is presented on how to measure and evaluate the impacts of a ULL on different levels. Therefore, a framework integrating the transition management approach and the multi-level perspective is developed and used for a mixed-methods evaluation approach of a ULL in a small rural town. The empirical results provide some evidence that after one year, the ULL activities cause some 'cracks in the wall' of the currently car-use dominated local mobility system: A significant decrease in the perceived social support of a local transport policy prioritizing car user needs is observed, as well as a significant decrease in the perceived social support for policy measures aiming to upgrade the existing car use infrastructure. Furthermore, citizens now perceive a higher local descriptive norm in favour of walking and cycling. However, ULL activities are not associated with a significant reduction of personal car use. Implications of the evaluation results for the further development of this specific local ULL as well as ULLs in general are discussed. Moreover, lines of psychological research aimed at supporting a better understanding of effective ULLs are described.

TI  - Towards attaining green sustainability goals of cities through social transitions: Comparing stakeholders' knowledge and perceptions between two Chesapeake Bay watersheds, USA
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Clean water is a significant challenge for the sustainability of expanding cities worldwide. The United Nations recognizes the importance of urban green space to improve sustainability and has proposed Sustainable Development Goals to be achieved by 2030. Political jurisdictions have their own sustainability goals and are instituting various policies to achieve them, but struggle to do so due to underlying socio-cultural, environmental, economic/financial, and other challenges. Utilizing a Community Based Participatory Research approach involving multi-stakeholders and transition management theory to frame different spheres of governance, this multi-disciplinary study aims to understand best management practices, sense of perceived responsibility, barriers, and future of Green Infrastructure (GI) in two Chesapeake Bay watersheds. We analyzed data from 42 indepth interviews as well as GI policies. We identified five categories of perceived barriers, socio-cultural being the dominant category. More meaningful outreach activities are needed to build trust with residents, which can be achieved through modern channels of communications including smartphone applications and social media. This trust will increase the GI adoption rates and improve water quality in the USA and elsewhere. This can be achieved through an integrated governance approach.

TI  - Accelerating innovation for the Dutch bioeconomy transition: the case of biobased asphalt
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores and explains the factors affecting the development of biobased innovations for the Dutch bioeconomy transition. Qualitative analysis through semi-structured interviews and secondary data was made on Bioasphalt as a case study to extract these factors from the empirical situation. Due to the scarcity of literature on biobased innovation for the bioeconomy, this research offers a base for policy makers to position the biobased innovations into the circular economy plans. The findings show that the urgency factor associated with the circular economy implantation has negatively affected the development of biobased innovations. On a micro level, the analyzed factors will assist niche actors in accelerating their biobased solutions. Although the innovation ecosystem structure highly depends on the nature of the technology or product, studies using similar approaches will allow for the generalization of the results.

TI  - Multiscalar energy transitions: Exploring the strategies of renewable energy cooperatives in South Korea
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate the multiscale roles of renewable energy cooperatives (RE co-ops) in South Korea. This paper focuses on citizen participatory RE co-ops as a niche that plays a vital role in the community-led energy pathway. This paper conducted a narrative analysis based on data about RE co-ops' current status and in-depth interviews. We analyzed core changes and inertia in the conventional energy system at the national, regional, and local scales by comparing within and between scales. Each scale consisted of a patchwork of distinguishable subregimes, i.e., market, policy, and culture. We argue that a niche plays the creative role of adjusting the subregimes at each scale grounded in manageable resources such as their economic means, bylaws, and relationships. By identifying a gap between the ideal community-led energy pathway and how each spatial scale works, we show that a strategic political process should fill the gap, especially when niche actors try to actualize energy transition under adverse conditions.

TI  - The transition of electrical systems to sustainability: Political and institutional drivers in Chile and Brazil
T2  - MRS ENERGY & SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Addressing climate change is one of the main challenges of twenty-first-century societies. In this context, the energy sector can contribute significantly to the reduction of anthropogenic emissions. Thus, global policies have focused on energy efficiency and the transition to non-conventional renewable energy sources. Still, unfortunately, these topics are often undeveloped and unstudied in countries of the Global South. In a tentative to fill this gap, this article focuses on the transition of the Chilean and Brazilian electrical systems. Notably, both countries have historically used hydro- and thermoelectricity as their predominant energy sources but introducing new resources in the latest years. Thus, this work aimed to analyze the creation and articulation of specific political-institutional arrangements to promote the energy matrix diversification from the beginning of this century and their possible effects on the energy transition process. Despite differences in their paths, the cases analyzed present common elements, such as the crises as triggers and the implementation of energy policy packages since the 2000s decade. Discussion The complexity of the current scenario stimulated by environmental and social demands requires increasingly comprehensive energy sustainable policies. Long-term energy policies and the design of State plans are pivotal to sustainable resources management, considering the vulnerability of electrical systems in the face of climate change. In this matter, new socio-political arrangements and broad citizen participation are essential.

AB  - This paper proposes a meta-theoretical framework for studying power in processes of change and innovation. Power is one of the most contested concepts in social and political theory. This paper discusses seven prevailing points of contestation: Power over versus power to, centred versus diffused, consensual versus conflictual, constraining versus enabling, quantity versus quality, empowerment versus disempowerment and power in relation to knowledge. The paper reviews how different scholars have dealt with above-mentioned points of contestation and identifies how different theories of power can be translated into specific empirical questions to systematically explore power in processes of social change and innovation.

AB  - In the scientific literature on energy transition toward decarbonization, the learning process is often described as a preferred way to achieve change. However, despite a large number of theoretical and empirical endeavors, a systematic understanding of the process is still lacking due to the diversity of disciplines and approaches and to the multi-layered nature of the phenomenon. The aim of this systematic review is to highlight the dimensions of learning processes from a cultural psychological point of view in order to understand and assess different planes of the relation between humans and technology. We thus explore the literature following the PRISMA protocol. Through a narrative synthesis, we critically assess the theoretical and methodological advancement, the presence of cultural determinants, the value ascribed to agency, and the depoliticization risk. We found that: theories and methodologies still lack systematicity and concordance in their application; learning processes are studied with little focus on the context and are mostly treated as facilitators; agency mostly lacks a psychosocial focus, despite the exploration of multi-level problems; and the depoliticization of learning is a matter of fact. Nevertheless, positive examples are present, although they are few. Epistemological and political implications are discussed, and a psychosocial conception of agency is proposed, together with a reflective stance for researchers.

TI  - To what extent are the antimalarial markets in African countries ready for a transition to triple artemisinin-based combination therapies?
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Triple artemisinin-based combination therapies (TACTs) are being developed as a response to artemisinin and partner drug resistance in the treatment of falciparum malaria in Southeast Asia. In African countries, where current artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are still effective, TACTs have the potential to benefit the larger community and future patients by mitigating the risk of drug resistance. This study explores the extent to which the antimalarial drug markets in African countries are ready for a transition to TACTs.Methods A qualitative study was conducted in Nigeria and Burkina Faso and comprised in-depth interviews (n = 68) and focus group discussions (n = 11) with key actor groups in the innovation system of antimalarial therapies.Results Evidence of ACT failure in African countries and explicit support for TACTs by the World Health Organization (WHO) and international funders were perceived important determinants for the market prospects of TACTs in Nigeria and Burkina Faso. At the country level, slow regulatory and implementation procedures were identified as potential barriers towards rapid TACTs deployment. Integrating TACTs in public sector distribution channels was considered relatively straightforward. More challenges were expected for integrating TACTs in private sector distribution channels, which are characterized by patient demand and profit motives. Finally, several affordability and acceptability issues were raised for which ACTs were suggested as a benchmark.Conclusion The market prospects of TACTs in Nigeria and Burkina Faso will depend on the demonstration of the added value of TACTs over ACTs, their advocacy by the WHO, the inclusion of TACTs in financial and regulatory arrangements, and their alignment with current distribution and deployment practices. Further clinical, health-economic and feasibility studies are required to inform decision makers about the broader implications of a transition to TACTs in African counties. The recent reporting of artemisinin resistance and ACT failure in Africa might change important determinants of the market readiness for TACTs.

TI  - Does finance as usual work for circular economy transition? A financiers and SMEs qualitative approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Transitioning to a circular economy (CE) particularly challenges small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and a deeper understanding of CE financial barriers is needed. We draw on SME and financiers' views to qualitatively study the risks associated with CE, how such risks limit access to financial resources and how financial institutions perceive those risks. We find that transitioning to a circular economy entails regulatory, cultural and market risks and that CE business success does not depend solely on SME resources or capabilities. Contributions include combining business model perspectives with transition theories and showing that new circular business models entail major reforms to political, regulatory, and market structures, including financial markets. From a practical perspective, to accelerate CE transition, we recommend reducing fragmentation, uncertainty and incoherence in regulation of the remodeling of information and risk assessment systems and new co-financing mechanisms and alternative instruments such as blended finance or "circular finance."

TI  - Surviving the Anthropocene: How evaluation can contribute to knowledge and better policymaking
T2  - EVALUATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We live in the Anthropocene in which human impact on Earth is the dominant force. At the same time, humans are very much part of the ecosystem. This close interdependency is brought home by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as by anthropogenic climate change. Ecosystem health and human health are closely interlinked. Transformational change is required to avoid further catastrophes caused by the three environmental crises that human actions have caused: climate crisis; nature crisis; and pollution and waste crisis. Evaluation can contribute to finding durable solutions based on sound science and experiences from the field, but to do so evaluation must broaden its vision. Theory-based approaches will remain central, but they must be open to the full human and natural systems in which the intervention that is the evaluand operates. Evaluations must also pay attention to unintended consequences of all interventions to the environment, to social and power relations, to women, indigenous peoples and vulnerable groups. I identify three principles for evaluation in the Anthropocene, at the nexus of human and natural systems, and illustrate them using examples from evaluations from the Global Environment Facility: (a) integrating human and natural systems; (b) geographical approaches; and (c) addressing the drivers.

TI  - A formative approach to the evaluation of Transformative Innovation Policies
T2  - RESEARCH EVALUATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Transformative Innovation Policies (TIPs) assert that addressing the key challenges currently facing our societies requires profound changes in current socio-technical systems. To leverage such 'socio-technical transitions' calls for a different, broad mix of research and innovation policies, with particular attention being paid to policy experiments. As TIPs diffuse and gain legitimacy they pose a substantial evaluation challenge: how can we evaluate these policy experiments with a narrow geographical and temporal scope, when the final objective is ambitiously systemic? How can we know whether a specific set of policy experiments is contributing to systemic transformation? Drawing on TIPs principles as developed by and applied in the activities of the Transformative Innovation Policy Consortium and on the concept of transformative outcomes, this article develops an approach to the evaluation of TIPs that is operational and adaptable to different contexts.

TI  - Sustainability Buckets: A Flexible Heuristic for Facilitating Strategic Investment on Place-Dependent Sustainability Narratives
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a heuristic framework to help respond to gaps in knowledge construction in sustainability transitions. Transition theory publications highlight concerns ranging from contentious understandings of sustainability to the need for generalisable conceptual frameworks around how place specificity matters in transitions. The heuristic presented here is a flexible framework for developing place-dependent narratives of sustainability transitions grounded in investment choices. The sustainability buckets development resulted from the abduction and retroduction methods. It was also underpinned by a praxis-oriented mechanism from business ('strategic investment buckets'), a transition theory conceptual framework ('the multi-level perspective'-MLP), and a social sciences heuristic ('sustainability cultures'). The sustainability buckets resulted from synthesising the critical literature with empirical findings drawn from two case studies in New Zealand. The heuristic proved helpful to navigate, organise, and code meanings and understandings of sustainability in the New Zealand agri-food context. It also helped facilitate dialogue with research participants from different backgrounds, such as government and business. The heuristic was designed to transform, remaining fit for purpose as transitions evolve. This article suggests the sustainability buckets could be used to enable investment opportunities for upscaling, reproducing, and transplanting transitions happening in distinct sectors and high-level systems.

TI  - Transitioning Responsibly Toward a Circular Bioeconomy: Using Stakeholder Workshops to Reveal Market Dependencies
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article reflects on the contribution that stakeholder involvement could give to circular bioeconomy transformation (CBE). By comparing argument for stakeholder involvement in literature as well as on our own experiences in six stakeholder involvement workshops, we argue that it is probably unrealistic to fully achieve both normative and co-design goals in a single workshop. Furthermore, stakeholder involvement can help to acquire insight into dependencies in the market and offer an opportunity to connect people to deal with them. Therefore we propose for future stakeholder involvement initiatives for CBE to focus on (1) identify relationships of dependency which make it hard for players in the market to change, (2) develop strategies to change while mitigating the detrimental effects on already existing relationships and (3) gradually breaking down relationships and building new ones that support CBE.

TI  - A multilevel transition perspective on embedding intersectoral action in local health policies
T2  - HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Intersectoral action is advocated as a social practice that can effectively address health inequalities and related social issues. Existing knowledge provides insight into factors that may facilitate or hinder successful intersectoral action, but not much is known about how intersectoral action evolves and becomes embedded in local health policies. This is where this study aims to make its contribution, by adopting the multilevel perspective on transitions, which is increasingly used to study social innovation in sustainability transitions but has not yet been applied to public health and health promotion. Through this perspective, it was unravelled how intersectoral action between youth-care organizations and community sports clubs became embedded in local health policies of Rotterdam, a large city in the Netherlands. A single explorative case study was conducted based on content analysis of policy documents and 15 in-depth interviews with policy officers, managers and field workers operating in the fields of youth and sports in Rotterdam. The findings showed that intersectoral action between community organizations and policymakers evolves through congruent processes at different levels that changed institutional logics. Moreover, it emerged that policymakers and other actors that advocate novel social practices and act as boundary spanners can adopt multiple strategies to embed these practices in local health policy. The multi-level perspective adds value to earlier approaches to research intersectoral collaboration for health promotion as it allows to better capture the politics involved in the social innovation processes. However, further sharpening and more comprehensive application of transition concepts to study transitions in public health and health promotion is needed.

TI  - Governance of nature-based solutions through intermediaries for urban transitions-A case study from Melbourne, Australia
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - As cities increasingly turn to nature-based solutions to address key urban socio-ecological challenges, approaches to their governance, planning and implementation are increasingly important for ensuring their effectiveness. Nature-based solutions are multifunctional, and so their planning and implementation are by necessity interdisciplinary. As such, to support urban transitions with nature-based solutions, the role of intermediary actors deserves research attention. Intermediaries play key roles in linking between sectors, across different levels of government and between disciplines and policy domains. We identified three key points for research and planning nature-based solutions through intermediaries as key agents for change: intermediaries are creators of enabling institutional spaces needed for mainstreaming nature-based solutions in cities; intermediaries as actor configurations are dynamic over time and in context, and intermediation has to be understood as a fundamental governance activity in cities that want to scale up their climate adaptation planning with nature-based solutions. Using a case study of the development and initial implementation of the metropolitan urban forest strategy in Melbourne Australia, we analyze the multi-actor landscape that emerged, through the lens of intermediation. We systematically investigated which actors, partnerships and platforms acted as intermediaries in the transformative agenda of the Urban Forest strategy, how these actors interacted over the course of the strategy's development and how their roles and functions shifted during the early implementation stages of the strategy. We found that an 'ecology of intermediaries' adopted a range of roles to support key functions including building collaboration, informing and disseminating policy learning, and strengthening political support. While intermediaries' roles and functions shifted across the strategy's development, their contributions were critical in the complex metropolitan governance context. Collaborative planning and governance for nature-based solutions in cities require intermediaries to remain topical, focused and inclusive/open to new ideas and lessons from innovations both emerging and driven.

TI  - What next? Leveraging a new global crisis to mitigate an older one: opportunities and challenges in Romania and Britain
T2  - TERRITORY POLITICS GOVERNANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 global health crisis has required direct governmental intervention in both social and economic spheres on a scale not seen in recent times in most European countries. Whereas the positive environmental gains made during the height of the so-called 'lockdown' response imposed by governments are likely to be short lived, the experience has demonstrated that amid an almost universally acknowledged immediate crisis, government intervention, substantial policy change and public opinion can all be mobilized for positive benefit. Given their limited record to date, both Romania and the UK have some way to go to enhance their efforts in combating the environmental crisis. The question for the sustainable transitions literature and wider advocates of sustainability is what could be done to mobilize a similar political and governmental response to the environmental crisis.

TI  - Techno-economic analysis and energy modelling as a key enablers for smart energy services and technologies in buildings
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Smart energy services and technologies are key components of energy transition and decarbonisation strategies for the built environment. On the one hand, the technical potential of the building stock in terms of energy, emissions and cost savings is large and exploited only partially at present. On the other hand, the increasing availability of data generated by smart meters, smart devices, sensors and building management systems can help monitoring, verifying and tracking building energy performance improvements in a transparent way. In particular, energy modelling and data analytics can provide empirically grounded and tested methods to standardize the way energy performance is measured and reported. Further, techno-economic analysis is crucial to ensure the feasibility of innovative business models. For these reasons, this paper aims to address the role of techno-economic analysis and energy modelling as key enablers for next-generation energy services and technologies. In terms of methods, scientific literature selection criteria are derived from previous research and are focused on limitations and bottlenecks to the achievement of innovative business models, which are motivated, at their very basics, by energy, emission and cost savings. Additionally, besides these potential savings, smart energy services and technologies can provide multiple additional benefits such as improved Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) and energy flexibility on the demand side, with respect to energy infrastructures. First, the research identifies the key elements that are necessary to integrate and to streamline techno-economic analysis and energy modelling processes. After that, it highlights potential advances in the broad area of energy transitions and decarbonisation of the built environment that can be achieved as an evolution of current practices and processes. Finally, it envisions the creation of "eco-systems" of interacting models for the building sector that share common underlying principles.

TI  - A framework for understanding the key drivers of cities' climate actions in city networks
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the complexity of environmental city networks, the incentives of climate actions in these networks are unclear. Despite their rise, the literature is yet to fully engage with this complexity, as siloed disciplinary focuses on specific aspects of climate actions in city networks are far behind explaining the reality of these networks. Since there is a dispersed understanding of climate actions in city networks across different fields of research, we adopt an interdisciplinary approach to identify the key drivers of climate actions in city networks. Urban studies' focus is on networking and the political economy behind it. On the other hand, sustainability transition studies has provided an in-depth understanding of the socio-cultural context, and scholars in environmental science illuminate the environmental context of cities. By synthesizing these three fields, this paper proposes a framework that ensures a comprehensive understanding of drivers of climate actions in city networks. It consists of thirteen attributes under four themes of networking context, political economy, socio-cultural context, and environmental context. The framework's utility is identifying the limitations of studies and a comprehensive comparison of cities to unpack the drivers of climate actions in city networks to encourage networking.

TI  - Multi-Level Perspective on Sustainability Transition towards Nature-Based Solutions and Co-Creation in Urban Planning of Belgrade, Serbia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, nature-based solutions have been increasingly promoted as a climate change adaptation instrument, strongly advocated to be co-created. Achieving clear, coherent, and ambitious urban greening strategies, embedded in urban planning and developed in a co-creative, participatory and inclusive manner, is highly challenging within the EU enlargement context. In this article, such challenges are studied through two recent urban development initiatives in Belgrade, the Capital of Serbia: the first initiative focuses on planning the new Linear Park, within the framework of the CLEVER Cities Horizon 2020 project; the second initiative envisages the transformation of the privatised Avala Film Complex in the Kosutnjak Urban Forest, primarily led by private interests but supported by the local authorities. The multiple-case study research method is applied, with an exploratory purpose and as a basis for potential future research on evaluation of co-creation processes for NBS implementation. The theoretical basis of this article is founded in the research on sustainability transitions, focusing on multi-level perspective (MLP) framework. The urban planning system in Belgrade and Serbia is observed as a socio-technical regime of the MLP. In such framework, we recognize co-creative planning of the Linear Park as a niche innovation. We interpret opposition towards planning of the Avala Film Complex as escalation, or an extreme element of the socio-technical landscape, comprised of civic unrests and political tensions on one side, combined with the climate crisis and excessive pollution on the other side. Moreover, the article examines informal urban planning instruments that can be implemented by the practitioners of niche innovations, that could support urban planners and NBS advocates in the Serbian and EU enlargement contexts to face the challenges of motivating all stakeholders to proactively, constructively and appropriately engage in co-creation.

TI  - We, the Change Outlining Research Lines of How Psychology Can Contribute to the Understanding of Societal Transition Processes
T2  - EUROPEAN PSYCHOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last years within sustainability research, the agreement seems to have changed about the appropriate strategies to solve the intensifying socio-ecological crisis. While the focus used to be on "greening" individual lifestyles, it has recently shifted to the fundamental transition of central societal production and consumption systems. This raises the question of what psychology with its traditional focus on the individual can contribute to a better understanding and successful design of such societal transition processes. The present paper aims to offer an outline of how such psychological research lines might look like. We use the social identity concept as a starting point and motivate it as central for understanding the transformation of an individual into a group member who voluntarily collaborates with others to create more sustainable socio-technical solutions for central societal needs. The three parts of our paper deliver compact descriptions of thought-provoking research lines which developed in the last years. These research lines contribute to a better understanding of how social identities as collective pro-environmental activists are "crafted," through which processes such as activist identities influence the participation in collective pro-environmental action and, ultimately, collective change. In sum, an important psychological contribution to the debate about the "Great Transformation" could be to provide a better understanding of what motivates individuals to actively participate in transition-oriented initiatives and how this motivation can be strengthened.

T2  - EUROPEAN PSYCHOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - The ongoing intensification of the socio-ecological crisis requires a "Great Transformation" (WBGU, 2011) of central societal systems involving aspects such as mobility, energy production, and nutrition. Thus, from a scientific point of view, the Great Transformation is a highly normative topic with a strong focus on societal and political processes of change. We are convinced that psychology can play a fruitful role in creating the social science for sustainability transformation that is needed for this purpose. However, for this to happen, psychology needs a shift toward a more impact-oriented research perspective, focusing on how people can effectively influence their ecological footprint and/or foster societal change as consumers, producers, or active citizens and community members. As starting points for developing such transformation-oriented psychological research perspectives, the present paper shows how a multilevel perspective on societal transformation processes can be combined with the vision of a solidarity-based lifestyle. Against this theoretical backdrop, we see an important role for psychology in studying how people cope with an ecological crisis by inventing new environmental lifestyles and identities, despite being locked into the currently unsustainable socio-technical systems.

TI  - Establishing the Regional Sustainable Developmental Role of Universities-From the Multilevel-Perspective (MLP) and Beyond
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article establishes the multilevel perspective (MLP) as one of the main research approaches in transition research to study complex systemic change processes in socio-technical systems at different structural levels. The application of the MLP to the higher education system, especially to conceptualize the transition of universities towards a sustainable (regional) developmental role, is still in its infancy. Through using a descriptive narrative analysis of seminal articles, the results of the four-years cooperation within an expert working group, and own empirical findings, the present paper investigates the suitability of the MLP to study the transition of universities and university systems towards a sustainable developmental role in the regional context. Based on these investigations, three further perspectives (which must be considered for establishing a more comprehensive understanding of the universities' sustainable developmental role) are identified and conceptualized: (a) The target dimension of sustainable regional development, (b) the role of agency, and (c) the introduction of space and place to multiscalar regional transitions. Based on these perspectives, a future research agenda beyond the MLP is developed.

TI  - Finding feasible action towards urban transformations
T2  - NPJ URBAN SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - While innovative approaches to urban transformations are increasingly proposed, scholars often overlook challenges faced by endogenous actors (e.g. urban planners) tasked with taking action within non-ideal, real-world settings. Here we argue that an 'inside' view of transformations (focused on judgment in practice) is needed to complement existing 'outside' views (focused on assessment), where the feasibility of action becomes a central concern. This recasts urban transformations in a discretised perspective. It suggests a view of transformation pathways as both directed and stochastic, and emergent from an unfolding series of 'fuzzy action moments'. Principles for bridging urban science and planning are derived.

AB  - To power cloud data centres (DCs) with renewable energy (RE) Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft negotiated innovative long-term contracts that opened up regional vertically integrated electricity utilities to allow new roles for large-scale suppliers and buyers of electricity. This transformation is explained using Williamson's framework of institutional change linking the four interdependent institutional levels of embedded values, regulatory environment, (interfirm) governance and resource allocation. This framework is extended geographically by incorporating the regional and national interactions necessary for locating and spatially diffusing RE-driven DCs across the USA based on new power purchases and green tariff contractural agreements.

TI  - Understanding the correlation between energy transition and urbanization
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Renewable energy and energy efficiency are recognized among the key factors of transitioning towards a low-consumption and low-carbon society. In order to achieve such transition, the government policies should be aimed at meeting the renewable energy generation and energy efficiency targets of specific localities. Nonetheless, these targets vary between different urban regions, and there is limited knowledge on the correlation between energy transition and urbanization levels. The aim of this paper is to identify that correlation in urban regions. This study places Italian regions under the microscope of an empirical investigation. The study adopts a twostep analysis that provides a useful model for regional analyses. The results of the study consolidates our understanding and highlights that the energy transition process requires greater efforts concerning social participation and provision of incentives for renewable energy production, mainly in the less urbanized areas.

TI  - Modelling the crisis management and impacts of 21st century disruptive events in tourism: the case of the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - TOURISM REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThis paper aims to analyse the most significant disruptive events affecting tourism during the twenty-first century, particularly the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.Design/methodology/approachBased on a thorough literature review, this study takes a complexity science approach to the field of tourism to shed light on the challenges of disruptive events in tourism systems.FindingsFocusing on the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, this study acknowledges that disruptive events are complex and have tremendous impacts on several areas of society: people's psychological well-being and the health-care system, as well as social, economic, cultural, technological, environmental and political dimensions. Whether they occur alone or interact, these dimensions add varying levels of complexity to the tourism system. In response, the tourism industry can adopt a resilience model as a crisis management tool to address disruptive events affecting this field.Research limitations/implicationsAs this paper is mainly theoretical, future empirical research will contribute to refining the findings and testing the usefulness of the proposed model.Practical implicationsThe paper looks at examples of successful and unsuccessful of COVID-19 outbreak management in various countries to analyse issues such as crisis management, resilience and tools for coping with the impacts of disruptive events.Originality/valueThis theoretical paper proposes a first taxonomy of the multidimensional impacts of twenty-first-century disruptive events on tourism and dissects the phases of crisis management, with a corresponding conceptual model.

TI  - Structural conditions for the wider uptake of urban nature-based solutions-A conceptual framework
T2  - CITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In policy and practice, urban Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) are considered promising innovations for sustainable urban transformation. NBS are interventions that use nature to address multiple sustainability challenges simultaneously. As such, they present a novel perspective on urban land use and development. Yet their current uptake into urban development lags behind EU ambitions. Drawing from transitions studies, this paper suggests that the limited uptake of NBS innovation stems from structural conditions that keep urban development systems locked in their current state, thereby favouring traditional 'grey' development. With a systematic literature review, we identify preliminary structural conditions that likely affect the uptake of urban NBS, culminating in a framework of 'urban infrastructure regimes', which we then illustrate with two European examples of urban NBS. Our findings indicate the relevance of using a transitions studies perspective for generating insights into the structural conditions - knowledge base, policy paradigms, etc. - that underlie barriers and opportunities for NBS uptake. We particularly argue that identifying the state and obduracy of these conditions provides a deeper understanding of how NBS uptake takes place. Findings also suggest that nature-based innovations require a customised transitions framework that accounts for the role of physical geographies.

TI  - Leveraging inner sustainability through cross-cultural learning: evidence from a Quichua field school in Ecuador
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Inner worlds and subjectivity are increasingly recognized as key dimensions of sustainability transformations. This paper explores the potential of cross-cultural learning and Indigenous knowledge as deep leverage points-hard to pull but truly transformative-for inner world sustainability transformations. In this exploratory study we propose a theoretical model of the inner transformation-sustainability nexus based on three distinctive inside-out pathways of transformation. Each pathway is activated at the inner world of individuals and cascades through the outer levels (individual and collective) of the iceberg model, ultimately resulting in transformations of the individual's relationship with others, non-humans, or oneself. Our main purpose is to empirically investigate the activation of inner leverage points among graduate students who are alumni of an Indigenous language field school in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Semi-structured interviews designed around three core aspects-(1) human-nature relationships; (2) subjective change; and (3) acknowledgment for Indigenous culture-yielded expressions of becoming aware of new forms of relationships and empirically illustrate the roles of deep leverage points in triggering the three inside-out pathways of our model. A strategic focus on activating inner levers could increase the effectiveness of cross-cultural learning in fostering transformations in relationships with non-humans, oneself and others that may yield sustainability outcomes.

TI  - Integrated pest management: good intentions, hard realities. A review
T2  - AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Integrated Pest Management (IPM) provides an illustration of how crop protection has (or has not) evolved over the past six decades. Throughout this period, IPM has endeavored to promote sustainable forms of agriculture, pursued sharp reductions in synthetic pesticide use, and thereby resolved myriad socio-economic, environmental, and human health challenges. Global pesticide use has, however, largely continued unabated, with negative implications for farmer livelihoods, biodiversity conservation, and the human right to food. In this review, we examine how IPM has developed over time and assess whether this concept remains suited to present-day challenges. We believe that despite many good intentions, hard realities need to be faced. 1) We identify the following major weaknesses: i) a multitude of IPM definitions that generate unnecessary confusion; ii) inconsistencies between IPM concepts, practice, and policies; iii) insufficient engagement of farmers in IPM technology development and frequent lack of basic understanding of its underlying ecological concepts. 2) By diverting from the fundamental IPM principles, integration of practices has proceeded along serendipitous routes, proven ineffective, and yielded unacceptable outcomes. 3) We show that in the majority of cases, chemical control still remains the basis of plant health programs. 4) Furthermore, IPM research is often lagging, tends to be misguided, and pays insufficient attention to ecology and to the ecological functioning of agroecosystems. 5) Since the 1960s, IPM rules have been twisted, its foundational concepts have degraded and its serious (farm-level) implementation has not advanced. To remedy this, we are proposing Agroecological Crop Protection as a concept that captures how agroecology can be optimally put to the service of crop protection. Agroecological Crop Protection constitutes an interdisciplinary scientific field that comprises an orderly strategy (and clear prioritization) of practices at the field, farm, and agricultural landscape level and a dimension of social and organizational ecology.

TI  - Transformative Potential and Learning Outcomes of Air Quality Citizen Science Projects in High Schools Using Low-Cost Sensors
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The rise of advanced ICT technologies has made it possible to apply low-cost sensor systems for measuring air quality in citizen science projects, including education. High school students in Norway used these sensor systems in a citizen science project to design, carry out, and evaluate their own research projects on air quality. An impact assessment framework was designed to assess the impact of these activities, considering five areas of impact: scientific, social, economic, political, and environmental. In addition, the framework also considers the transformative potential of the citizen science pilot, i.e., the degree to which the pilot can help to change, alter, or replace current systems, and the business-as-usual in one or more fields such as knowledge production or environmental protection. Data for this assessment were gathered in the form of questionnaires that the students had to complete before starting and after finalizing the pilot activities. The results showed positive impacts on learning, a pro-environmental world view, and an increase in pro-science attitudes and interest in scientific and environmental-related topics at the end of the pilot activities. Only weak impacts were measured for behavioral change. The activities showed transformative potential, which makes the student activities an example of good practice for citizen science activities on air quality with low-cost sensors.

TI  - The Business Model in Sustainability Transitions: A Conceptualization
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Business models direct a firm's activity to move in coherence with the objectives of the business. Current literature suggests business models can act as vital forces to facilitate sustainability transitions and highlights the urgent research call to understand the role of business model innovations in stimulating sustainability transitions. This paper addresses this research need by investigating how firms create business model innovations for system-level transformation towards sustainability. Through a systematic literature review and deductive content analysis methodology, we identify and categorize different combinations of innovative activities in a firm's business model. Furthermore, two cases are illustrated to demonstrate the proposed conceptual model. The proposed conceptualization bridges a significant gap in the theme of sustainability and business and presents a defensible and researchable problem for transitions literature. Specifically, we find (1) shared vision and strategic dialogues among firms in different sectors as essential to develop value propositions and leverage business opportunities for sustainability in the long run; (2) companies ensure sustainable value creation and value delivery in the medium term through creation of an interdependent network of the green supply chain and collaboration with stakeholders; (3) in the short term, companies adopt sustainable practices, controlling daily operations, conducting awareness campaigns and experimenting with collaborations to deliver values based on sustainable practices.

TI  - Trading radical for incremental change: the politics of a circular economy transition in the German packaging sector
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY & PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding environmental politics is crucial for sustainability transitions. We study the transition politics of the shift to a circular economy in the German packaging sector, particularly the curious case of the 2019 German Packaging Act. While the policy was born out of the unanimous wish for radical regulatory change, all actors evaluate the outcome as incremental. Following the Discursive Agency Approach and drawing upon actor interviews and documents, we show that actors' perceived fears of radical changes are critical for transition politics. This fear created a lock-in of two narratives, proposing conflicting organizational designs of packaging waste management. While the narrative lock-in was resolved by trading radical for incremental change, it left many conflicts and challenges unresolved. Our findings suggest that actors' fears not only prevent radical regulatory change but also create incremental change that may intensify unresolved conflicts and, thus, further weaken the actors' capacities for future transition politics.

TI  - Assessing nature-based solutions for transformative change
T2  - ONE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Global sustainability targets demand transformative changes. Nature-based solutions (NbS) are gaining traction in science and policy, but their potential for transformative change remains unexplored. We provide a framework to evaluate how NbS contribute to transformative change and apply it to 93 NbS from mountain social-ecological systems (SES). The framework serves to assess what elements may catalyze transformative change, how transformative change occurs, and what its outcomes are. Our results show that NbS are as much "people based'' as "nature based.'' Most NbS are based on four elements with transformation poten-tial: nature's values, knowledge types, community engagement, and nature management practices. Our results confirm the potential of NbS for transformative change, observed through changes in non-sustainable trajectories of SES. We illustrate the components of our framework through a novel classification of NbS. The framework provides key components for assessing the effectiveness of NbS and allows tracking long-term transformative change processes.

TI  - The potential contribution of urine source separation to the SDG agenda - a review of the progress so far and future development options
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Sanitation and wastewater management are highly relevant for reaching a number of interconnected sustainable development goals (SDGs), especially SDG 6, the provision of safe drinking water and adequate sanitation for all as well as protection of water resources against pollution, and SDG 14.1, reducing nutrient emissions to the marine environment. Recent evidence increasingly shows that conventional sewer-based wastewater management will not be able to reach these targets. Rather than further optimizing and diffusing this ageing infrastructure paradigm, radical innovations like urine source separation technologies could help to leapfrog towards faster achievement of the SDGs. The technology would simplify on-site sanitation and develop a closed-loop nutrient cycle, thereby allowing for exceptionally high nutrient removal from wastewater and direct reuse in agriculture from the first day of implementation. Radical innovations, however, need decades to materialize. Based on a review of relevant academic and grey literature, we show how the past three decades of development of urine source separation have brought breakthroughs in toilet design and treatment processes, enabling the technology's value chain to reach the brink of maturity. In a short outlook, we discuss how the technology may reach global diffusion over the next decade, with the main remaining challenges relating to the creation of mass-markets for urine-diverting toilets, automation and mass-production of treatment systems, and the legitimation of fertilizer produced from urine in the agricultural sector.

TI  - How creativity can help research on the multiple values of nature become more innovative and inclusive
T2  - PEOPLE AND NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The global environmental situation presents humans with challenges of unprecedented complexity, and research into the multiple values of nature aims to inform decision-making in the context of this complexity.Research suggests that creativity can be a crucial tool in confronting complexity, crises and novel situations.I argue that research into the multiple values of nature should intentionally seek and embrace creativity in approaches, methods and techniques. I draw on diverse fields to summarize the importance of creativity in navigating complex situations and crises.I present specific strategies drawn from the literature on creativity and innovation and link them to research on the multiple values of nature. These strategies are: Define the problem carefully and intentionally; be inspired by others' work; nurture scepticism and be open-minded; don't use only words; iterate and 'fail early, fail often'; and embrace teamwork. I describe each strategy, then offer thoughts on how each relates to research on the multiple values of nature.To conclude, I address caveats to the use of creativity in multiple-values-of-nature research and suggest the transformative role that rich, collaborative and creative study of the multiple values of nature may play.A free Plain Language Summary can be found within the Supporting Information of this article.

TI  - Mountain futures: pursuing innovative adaptations in coupled social-ecological systems
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Covering about 12.5% of the Earth's terrestrial surface, mountains have great value for people and nature. They provide habitat for one-third of terrestrial species diversity, have irreplaceable cultural and spiritual worth to humans, and are a source of fresh water for nearly 2 billion people. To date, progress on meeting policy goals to protect mountain systems has been slow; however, in 2019, several major reports on the contributions alpine environments make to life on Earth were produced by international agencies. These reports call for transformative change in decision making to address problems of sustainability in mountain ecosystems. We consider prospects for such change by reviewing several international partnerships focused on mountains. We then spotlight the Mountain Futures Initiative, which provides multiple examples of innovative local/regional research that give special focus to linking science with local livelihood support. Communities in alpine regions will continue to require assistance if they are to adapt to the environmental and social shifts characteristic of life in the Anthropocene.

TI  - Leveraging Nature-based Solutions for transformation: Reconnecting people and nature
T2  - PEOPLE AND NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nature-based Solutions (NbS) have rapidly been gaining traction across the research, policy and practice spheres, advocated as transformative actions to jointly address biodiversity loss and climate change. However, there are multiple, alternative ways to conceptualize NbS across those three spheres.To inform the NbS discourses in research, policy and practice, we critically reflect on the prevailing framing of NbS. Although the concept links environmental health to human well-being, we argue that its current dominant framing reinforces a dichotomy between people and nature by highlighting one, external nature working for the benefit of society. For the NbS concept to support transformation, we believe it must embody a reframing of human-nature relationships towards regenerative relationships between humans and nature.To support the transformative aspirations of NbS, we propose a novel core framing of NbS making explicit the co-dependence of people and nature, which underpins human well-being and environmental health. We highlight how such a framing can support a transformation through influencing beliefs and normative values, and second, through the communication and application of the NbS concept in research, policy and practice.We then elaborate on how such a framing is key to support inclusivity and collaboration between diverse research perspectives, policy objectives across scales and implementation practices to deliver just and successful NbS.A free Plain Language Summary can be found within the Supporting Information of this article.

TI  - Lessons from a pandemic for systems-oriented sustainability research
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Review
AB  - This review examines research on environmental impacts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from a systems-oriented sustainability perspective, focusing on three areas: air quality and human health, climate change, and production and consumption. The review assesses whether and how this COVID-19-focused research (i) examines components of an integrated system; (ii) accounts for interactions including complex, adaptive dynamics; and (iii) is oriented to informing action. It finds that this research to date has not comprehensively accounted for complex, coupled interactions, especially involving societal factors, potentially leading to erroneous conclusions and hampering efforts to draw broader insights across sustainability-relevant domains. Lack of systems perspective in COVID-19 research reflects a broader challenge in environmental research, which often neglects societal feedbacks. Practical steps through which researchers can better incorporate systems perspectives include using analytical frameworks to identify important components and interactions, connecting frameworks to models and methods, and advancing sustainability science theory and methodology.

TI  - On the Road of Discovery with Systemic Exploratory Constellations: Potentials of Online Constellation Exercises about Sustainability Transitions
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainability transitions are shaped by specific dynamics, dependencies, and influences among the actors and elements that are part of the system. Systemic constellations as a social science research method can offer tangible visualizations of such system dynamics and thereby extract valuable, often hidden knowledge for research. This article builds on two online exploratory system constellation exercises about sustainability transitions, with two major objectives: (i) to introduce and disseminate (exploratory) systemic constellations as a method for (sustainability) research, and (ii) to extract their potential for (online) collaborative and transdisciplinary research, with a focus on sustainability transitions. Our exploratory research design includes participatory action research that took place during the virtual International Sustainability Transitions Conference 2020, Vienna, Austria. Data were analyzed following an interpretative-hermeneutic approach. The main findings consist of visualizations about sustainability transition dynamics between selected actors in Germany and Portugal that are discussed in light of the literature on constellation work and sustainability transitions, triggering new assumptions: (i) a strong sustainability narrative does not (necessarily) lead to action and transformation and (ii) transformation requires integrating narratives beyond weak and strong sustainability. We conclude with a list of potentials of exploratory constellations for sustainability research and online formats that offer novelties such as a constant bird-eye perspective on the system while simultaneously engaging with the system.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FINANCE & INVESTMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Companies need to rethink the way they create value and grow their business to thrive in tomorrow's volatile and uncertain business environment. Companies in virtually every industry are impacted by new disruptive societal trends, such as climate change, energy transition and social inequality. At the same time, companies are increasingly evaluated on their sustainability performance.Still, only a few companies have begun to invent new strategic directions, pioneering strategies focused on creating long-term value, not just for shareholders but for all stakeholders. A playbook on how to create long-term value is currently lacking, making it difficult for companies to capture the opportunities and mitigate the risks created by these societal trends.This paper develops a model of long-term value creation that supports companies in creating long-term value and setting their strategies accordingly. Financial institutions can draw on the model to assess how future proof their investment and/or lending portfolios are.

TI  - Roadmap to Biodegradable Plastics-Current State and Research Needs
T2  - ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plastics, with their ubiquitous presence in our daily lives and environment, pose an uncomfortable conundrum. Producers and consumers are aware of the value of these organic ingredients in material flow, yet their persistence and disruption to the ecological milieu desperately stipulate a shift in the status quo. Biodegradable plastics-as the name suggests-has its appeal in ensuring the safe return of carbon to ecosystems by complete assimilation of the degraded product as a food source for soil or aquatic microorganisms. However, despite more than a decade of commercial presence, these plastics are still far from replacing the Development Testing demand for fossil-fuel-based commodity plastics. We discuss this apparent disconnect herein through a material value chain perspective. We review the current state of commercial biodegradable plastics and contrast it against the desired state of the zero-waste-focused circular economy. To close the gap, we suggest critical research needs concerning the structure and properties of biodegradable plastics, testing standards, application development, and waste management. The ultimate success in displacing conventional plastics with biodegradable alternatives will be predicated on collaboration between all stakeholders across the product value chain.

TI  - Learning from emancipation: The Port Royal Experiment and transition theory
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last decade, transition studies has emerged as an intellectual field aimed at answering the question: How do we get to a more sustainable world? Emerging from a combination of science and technology studies, evolutionary economics, and studies of innovation, transition studies has become a widely used conceptual tool to frame pathways to a more sustainable future. However, its embrace of a systems approach to change, I will argue, transition studies remains unengaged with critical theories of change in sociology, history, and political economy. In addition, geographers have critiqued transition studies for its lack of attention to spatial relationships. Using a particular historical case study of transition in a particular place-the Port Royal "Free Labor" emancipation experiments in the South Carolina Sea Islands during the Civil War-this paper explores both the weaknesses and the strengths of transition studies as a conceptual tool, and how attention to critical and spatial approaches to change can improve our understanding of transitions. In particular, I will show how a political ecology, as a critical and spatial approach, can improve transition studies. I will use a historical case, the Port Royal emancipation experiments, to illustrate how the addition of political ecology to transition studies can improve one's understanding of sustainable transition pathways.

TI  - Course change: Navigating urban passenger transport toward sustainability through modal shift
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Staying within the 2 degrees C (preferably 1.5 degrees C) limit requires fast and fundamental system changes, also in urban passenger transport. Shifting car traffic to environmentally friendly transport modes is one central strategy to make urban transport more sustainable and climate friendly. However, in most cities car use remains high. Therefore, this paper analyzes what course change is needed regarding direction, scale and speed of change for urban sustainability and climate protection reasons. The paper analyzes the role of modal shift as a strategy in itself and in relation to land-use (avoid) and efficiency (improve) measures. The paper draws on insights from European frontrunning cities and explorative forecasting scenarios calculated with the sophisticated integrated land-use transport model "Ruhr Region 2050". The paper suggests that a significant reduction of urban car use is needed (direction) that roughly equals a fast halving of car use (scale), which has proven feasible under the current socio-political conditions by annual reduction rates of 0.5 to 1.5 percentage points of the trip-based modal share of car use (speed). Significantly reducing car use requires comprehensive and high-intensive measures that go far beyond usual practices. Modal shift measures need to play a crucial role in integrated approaches with land-use (avoid) and efficiency (improve) measures because they have the potential to significantly reduce car use and CO2 emissions and because they can produce comparatively fast effects - which makes modal shift measures first aid approaches to achieve a fast "bending of the curve" of excessive car use and growing CO2 emissions.

TI  - The Waste-Resource Paradox: Practical dilemmas and societal implications in the transition to a circular economy
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Union has vowed to transition from a linear to a circular economy (CE). Many innovations, new business models, and policies have begun to emerge to support the push for further institutionalizing CE practices. A large portion of these attempts are based on transforming a flow currently labeled as a waste stream into a value proposition, i.e. a resource. However, this ironically increases the risk of creating a demand for these waste streams, which thereby may become commodified. In this article, we unpack the inherent dilemmas and implications created by this phenomenon, which we define as the Waste-Resource Paradox (WRP). Understanding the WRP is highly relevant, as its manifestation may lead to situations in which the further establishment of "circular" practices may reinforce linear economy by sustaining a waste (over)production in the system or causing undesired social or environmental repercussions. This can tighten a lock-in of the existing linear structures counteractive to CE that have not been explicitly identified or explored to date. We observed that the WRP may evolve and morph throughout time, across boundaries or respective to different societal sectors. Based on our findings, we highlight the profound implications of the WRP for the future of circularity and the potential consequences for a transition to CE. (c) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Development of a forest-based bioeconomy in Finland: Insights on three value networks through expert views
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - It is uncertain how the traditional forest sector can respond to the changing political environment, evolving markets, and global environmental problems. This study focuses on the development of forest-based bioeconomy (BE) in Finland from the perspective of three forest-based value networks (wooden multistory construction, fiber-based packaging, and biorefining) and thus breaks the tendency of siloed discussions. The study of expert opinions applies a collaborative interdisciplinary research method that combines group discussions and follow-up survey data. The results indicate that transformational regulation, proper incentives, and ways of increasing interaction at the business-consumer interface are required to support the creation of new practices and the destruction of old practices in the industry renewal.

T2  - ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING AND DESIGN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Positive Energy Buildings (PEBs) represent an emerging paradigm for high performance in the building sector. This paradigm focuses on the possibility of exploiting the interaction between individual NZEBs and smart Smart Grids, using energy surplus exchange. Acknowledging this technical potential, building sector should re-think the role of individual buildings as nodes of intelligent energy infrastructures with large penetration of distributed renewable energy resources. This requires a better understanding of the emerging properties related to PEBs and an organisation of new alliances across sectors in order to put PEBs nets into practice. However, there is no evidence of a comprehensive socio-technical framework concerning PEBs nets working at scale. This paper aims to fill this gap. Through a literature review, based on Constructive Grounded Theory Method, it proposes a new conceptual framework focused on Buildings-as-Energy-Service as a key enabler for creating PEBs nets. Research findings are organised according to four integrated lines of research, which describe: the trajectory towards PEBs nets; the management of new alliances across sectors; the definition of an ecosystem of applications for PEBs; and, the socio-technical implications in putting PBEs into practice. These research lines may contribute to re-inventing the role of the building sector in delivering tailor-made products and services for a low carbon society. Thus, academic and non-academic stakeholders in the fields of Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Planning might find this conceptual framework useful, as it summarises significant potential interactions among these sectors, emerging from recent studies.

TI  - Citizen Science for Transformative Air Quality Policy in Germany and Niger
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - How can citizen science projects advance the achievement of transformative air quality-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Germany and Niger? We investigate the promise of using citizen-generated data (CGD) as an input for official SDG monitoring and implementation in a multidisciplinary project, based on activities undertaken in Niger and Germany ranging from surveys, action research, policy and legislative analysis and environmental monitoring in Niamey and Leipzig, respectively. We critically describe and evaluate the great potential, but very limited actual use of CGD sources for these global goals in both contexts from technical and policy perspectives. Agenda 2030 provides an opportunity to tackle indoor and outdoor air quality in a more integrated and transformative perspective. However, we find this agenda to be remarkably absent in air quality policy and monitoring plans. Likewise, we find no meaningful links of existing citizen science initiatives to official air quality policy. We propose how SDGs-aligned citizen science initiatives could make major contributions to environmental and health monitoring and public debate, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. This however requires researchers to more strategically link these initiatives to policymakers and policy frameworks, such as SDG indicators and the governance structures in which they are embedded.

TI  - Accountability and sustainability transitions
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - What constitutes a sustainability transition? We identify sustainability transitions as premised on shifts in accountability relations ? assessments of conformance with institutional controls coupled with application of sanctions, incentives, and subsidies ? which structure the selection pressures that shape future demographics, technical practices, and social and material trajectories of an economic sector or domain. Contestation and adaptation of accountability mechanisms lend themselves to empirical observation. Beyond evaluating institutional changes that might support a sustainability transition, our analytic framework positions us to identify incoherent, hollow and regressive modes of accountability that constrain sustainability transitions. To operationalize our conceptual scheme, we analyze a purported case of sustainability transitions, solar energy in Portugal during the period 2017?2020. This empirical analysis juxtaposes the promise of movement to a more equitable, low-carbon energy future with institutional and material inertia. We draw on expert interviews, field observation and secondary research to apply accountability analysis to this energy transition case. We find evidence of shifts in relations of accountability that bode well for accelerated growth of solar uptake in Portugal. More broadly, this pilot application of an analytic framework for studying relations of accountability shows significant promise for advancing environmental governance research.

TI  - What are the regionally specific institutions that matter for renewable energy deployment and how can they be identified? Some insights from Italian regions
T2  - LOCAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - While energy transition processes are embedded in locally and regionally specific institutions, infrastructures and natural environments challenges remain in identifying the institutions that matter for renewable energy deployment, how they work and how they influence energy transition at the regional level. The paper discusses the institutional configurations, discernible by looking at the influence that the socio-material forms of energy exert on energy infrastructure, and its governance. It is argued that the socio-material dimensions of renewable energy are useful to emphasise the institutions that matter for renewable energy deployment and can shed light on the capacity of regional governments to steer renewable energy transitions. By adopting a comparative case study approach, the paper stresses the way in which the normative and cultural contexts of the regions under-consideration have influenced and modulated the effects of national regulatory schemes on renewable energy deployment. While similar institutional settings have worked in different ways across the regions investigated, the approach adopted is helpful in emphasising the relational and multi-scalar character of institutions and their effect on the regional capacity, and capability, to act in renewable energy deployment.

TI  - Methodology to identify demand-side low-carbon innovations and their potential impact on socio-technical energy systems
T2  - METHODSX
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid diffusion of demand-side low-carbon innovations has been identified as a key strategy for maintaining average global temperature rise at or below 1.5 degrees C. Diffusion research tends to focus on a single sector, or single technology case study, and on a small scope of factors that influence innovation diffusion. This paper describes a novel methodology for identifying multiple demand-side innovations within a specific energy system context and for characterizing their impact on socio-technical energy systems. This research employs several theoretical frameworks that include the Energy Technology Innovation System (ETIS) framework to develop a sample of innovations; the Sustainability Transitions framework to code innovations for their potential to impact the socio-technical system; the energy justice framework to identify the potential of innovations to address aspects of justice; and how characteristics of innovations are relevant to Innovation Adoption. This coding and conceptualization creates the foundation for the future development of quantitative models to empirically assess and quantify the rate of low-carbon innovation diffusion as well as understanding the broader relationship between the diffusion of innovations and socio-technical system change. The three stages of research are:Contextualization: surveys and desk research to identify low-carbon innovations across the ETIS;Decontextualization: the development of a codebook of variablesRecontextualization: coding the innovations and analysis.

TI  - Restructuring existing value networks to diffuse sustainable innovations in food packaging
T2  - INDUSTRIAL MARKETING MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable innovations in food packaging are important in terms of preventing food waste and reducing environmental impact, but existing industry regimes and networks may hinder their diffusion into established markets. However, research on reorientation of existing industries, and value networks in that situation, has been limited. This study examines the changes to existing industry value networks that can facilitate the diffusion of sustainable innovation in food packaging. Empirically, the transformation and distribution of agro-food waste into a new bioplastic packaging through the existing food packaging value network is investigated. As a result, the changes to the existing value network and their connections, facilitating the diffusion of the sustainable innovation, are identified at three levels ? firm, network, and macro. The findings show the importance of opportunity recognition, but also the role of new actors, resources, activities, and relationships in the restructuring of the existing value network and actions creating supportive regulative framework and increasing market demand for such renewal. This creates understanding of how the adoption of sustainable innovations, such as new packaging materials, which might seem simple, is complicated by the broad changes required from the existing value network.

TI  - Our future in the Anthropocene biosphere
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed an interconnected and tightly coupled globalized world in rapid change. This article sets the scientific stage for understanding and responding to such change for global sustainability and resilient societies. We provide a systemic overview of the current situation where people and nature are dynamically intertwined and embedded in the biosphere, placing shocks and extreme events as part of this dynamic; humanity has become the major force in shaping the future of the Earth system as a whole; and the scale and pace of the human dimension have caused climate change, rapid loss of biodiversity, growing inequalities, and loss of resilience to deal with uncertainty and surprise. Taken together, human actions are challenging the biosphere foundation for a prosperous development of civilizations. The Anthropocene reality-of rising system-wide turbulence-calls for transformative change towards sustainable futures. Emerging technologies, social innovations, broader shifts in cultural repertoires, as well as a diverse portfolio of active stewardship of human actions in support of a resilient biosphere are highlighted as essential parts of such transformations.

TI  - Transforming science and society? Methodological lessons from and for transformation research
T2  - RESEARCH EVALUATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Transformation research has in the past years emerged as a shared lens to study and support radical societal change towards sustainability. Given the nascent and exploratory-yet highly normative and ambitious-character of transformation research, we aim to enhance the understanding of transformation research: when do research designs qualify as transformation research, what is needed for putting transformation research into practice, and what are results? To this end, we develop a framework that identifies criteria for designing and reflecting on research results, design and processes as transformation research. We employ this framework to reflect on our work in a research project that was designed in the spirit of transformation research: The TRAFIS (Transformations towards resource-conserving and climate-resilient coupled infrastructures) project sought to understand and support the development of innovative coupled infrastructures to mobilize their critical role in achieving sustainability transformations. Our results yield lessons and recommendations about what transformation research looks like in practice and how it can be strengthened, focussing on 1, redefining and re-valuing research for societal impact; 2, redesigning research to integrate perspectives on radical societal change; and 3, re-equipping researchers and research partners for social learning. We conclude that while transformation research already contributes to framing and generating knowledge about realworld sustainability challenges, its transformative impact is still limited. Practicing transformation research requires far-reaching changes in the science system, but also continuous reflection about legitimacy, power relations, and impacts.

TI  - Clinical genetics in transition-a comparison of genetic services in Estonia, Finland, and the Netherlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Genetics has traditionally enabled the reliable diagnosis of patients with rare genetic disorders, thus empowering the key role of today's clinical geneticists in providing healthcare. With the many novel technologies that have expanded the genetic toolkit, genetics is increasingly evolving beyond rare disease diagnostics. When placed in a transition context-like we do here-clinical genetics is likely to become a fully integral part of future healthcare and clinical genetic expertise will be required increasingly outside traditional clinical genetic settings. We explore transition effects on the thinking (culture), organizing (structure), and performing (practice) in clinical genetics, taking genetic healthcare in Estonia, Finland, and the Netherlands as examples. Despite clearly distinct healthcare histories, all three countries have initially implemented genetic healthcare in a rather similar fashion: as a diagnostic tool for predominantly rare congenital diseases, with clinical geneticists as the main providers. Dynamics at different levels, such as emerging technologies, biobanks and data infrastructure, and legislative frameworks, may require development of a new system attuned with the demands and (historic) context of specific countries. Here, we provide an overview of genetic service provisions in Estonia, Finland, and the Netherlands to consider the impact of historic and recent events on prospective developments in genetic healthcare.

TI  - Flatpack democracy: Power and politics at the boundaries of transition
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper seeks to critically assess how "radical" sustainability approaches that challenge "mainstream" development trajectories-and politics-are crafted and contested within local government. We explore the extent to which these approaches account for a consolidation, break down or transformation of role boundaries and political identities and their implications for the politics of niche-regime dynamics. In our in-depth study of Independents for Frome (Somerset, UK), an "independent" group who took control of the town council in 2011 and consolidated a non-partisan approach within its administrative functions, referred to as its "Flatpack Democracy" model, we take a closer look at adversarialism and the intersection of power dynamics within local government. The findings reveal the capture of local mainstream political institutions by niche "protagonists" through an orchestration and consolidation of transition governance, woven in strategically and opportunistically into new forms of localized political identities at the niche-regime interface, which helped to create a community-level regime of transition governance. We suggest that informal institutional capital, such as the role of personal ties can impact on legitimacy, accountability, or the validation of sustainability agendas. Our findings also advance debates on transition thresholds within "liminal transition spaces", interstitial spaces between a previous way of knowing and doing, and a new way. Here ground rules dictating socio-political norms are unclear, collaborative actions are potentially working at cross-purposes and/or multiple forms of (transformative) power are exercised simultaneously at distinct moments, or instantiations of transition. That is, there remains a much-needed theoretical debate around the fragile and imperfect processes of democratization within the everyday politics of transition management.

TI  - Sociotechnical stability and equilibrium
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on sociotechnical transitions depends on the identification of stable sociotechnical systems (STS) and evaluating when, why, and how they change. However, much research on STS includes only implicit reference to system stability. In contrast, research on social-ecological systems (SES) has a long history of investigating stability and equilibrium. In this text, we identify how stability is incorporated in SES research, and we identify three roles that equilibrium often takes in this process. We use these insights to inform our review of sociotechnical transitions literature and identify three pillars of sociotechnical stability. Reviewing literature on sociotechnical transitions through a focus on stability and equilibrium highlights important areas for future research on STS and how they change. Explicit and descriptive research on sociotechnical stability can help differentiate stochastic change from sociotechnical transition and improve understanding of sociotechnical resilience.

T2  - BIOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accelerating declines in biodiversity and unmet targets in the Convention on Biological Diversity's 2010-2020 Strategic Plan for Biodiversity are stimulating widespread calls for transformative change. Such change includes societal transitions toward sustainability, as well as in specific content of the CBD's draft Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. We summarize research on transformative change and its links to biodiversity conservation, and discuss how it may influence the work of the CBD. We identify five steps to inject transformative change into the design and implementation of a new post-2020 framework: Pay attention to lessons learned from transitions research, plan for climate change, reframe area-based conservation, scale up biodiversity mainstreaming, and increase resources. These actions will transform the very nature of work under the CBD; a convention based on voluntary implementation by countries and facilitated by international administrators and experts must now accommodate a broader range of participants including businesses, Indigenous peoples, and multiple nonstate actors.

TI  - The technological and social timelines of climate mitigation: Lessons from 12 past transitions
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Delivering net zero by 2050 will require governments to utilise all available abatement opportunities, yet current policy largely ignores socially-driven mitigation in favour of technological innovation in the energy sector. Past energy transitions have typically taken several decades, but policymakers remain confident that low carbon technology can be deployed in time for a 2050 mitigation target. We consider the potential for social transitions to deliver emissions reductions within this time frame. Based on detailed analysis of 12 past transitions, we develop frameworks for technological and social transitions which draw out the relationships between progress, policy and diffusion. Using our generalised frameworks we compare the duration of transitions, finding that the technological transitions in our study take on average four decades longer than the social transitions to go from initial conception to market or behaviour saturation. Our evidence suggests that policymakers who continue to rely on technology transitions to reduce emissions will be unable to deliver climate targets by 2050. By engaging with the public to stimulate social transitions governments could have more impact, more swiftly. Only by utilising both technological and social transitions can policymakers hope to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

TI  - Decarbonisation of the power sector to engender a 'Just transition' in Japan: Quantifying local employment impacts
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - "Just Transition" is an important, brand new concept to implement policies towards decarbonisation of the power sector in Japan. However, a knowledge gap still remains between this concept and policy discussion at a practical level. Therefore, using the existing scenarios of decarbonisation of the power sector and employment factors for the power sector based on extended input-output tables, this study analysed "Just Transition" issues, looking at the concept from three aspects: distributional justice to identify key impacts by location and economic sector; recognition justice to assess key inequalities; and procedural justice which deal with fair process and possible measures to enhance acceptability of climate policies. The results of this study show that achieving decarbonisation of the power sector provides a net increase in domestic employment and supplies stable jobs in rural areas, thereby contributing to the revitalisation of the local economy. Furthermore, it improves inequalities in the working age population. Support from either national or local government is required to ensure a workforce is in place to enable a rapid increase in renewable energy. To achieve decarbonisation of the power sector with high political acceptability, it is essential to make early decision on the retirement of conventional power plants and to implement policy support for the surplus workers from conventional power plants.

TI  - The Debate If Agents Matter vs. the System Matters in Sustainability Transitions-A Review of the Literature
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - Transition studies is a growing discipline for addressing sustainability challenges. Traditionally, its focus has been at the system level. However, addressing sustainability challenges also requires attending to the role of agents in sustainability transitions. This is the focus adopted in this paper. We review the literature on agency in sustainability transitions, based on 77 journal articles on sustainability transitions listed in Scopus from 2014 to 2018. We find that agency is increasingly explored in the sustainability transitions literature. Despite this growing interest, this body of knowledge remains scattered in regard to typologies or theoretical framings. Our review leads us to identify three recurring themes. One theme drew our attention in particular: the transition research community is divided into those who argue that agency is sufficiently embedded in the transition literature and those who oppose this argument. Going forward, the dynamics of individual-level agency, including behaviors and motivation, deserve further attention.

TI  - Addressing perinatal health inequities in Dutch municipalities: Protocol for the Healthy Pregnancy 4 All-3 programme
T2  - HEALTH POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Health inequities are already present at birth and affect individuals' health and socioeconomic outcomes across the life course. Addressing these inequities requires a cross-sectoral approach, covering the first 1,000 days of life. We believe that in the Dutch context municipal governments can be the main responsible actor to drive such an approach, since they are primarily responsible for organising adequate public health. Therefore, we aim to identify and develop transformative change towards the implementation of perinatal health into municipal approaches and policies concerning health inequities. Methods: A transition analysis will be combined with action research in six Dutch municipalities. Interviews and interactive group sessions with professionals and organisations that are relevant for the institutional embedding of perinatal health into approaches and policies regarding health inequities, will be organised in each municipality. As a follow-up, a questionnaire will be administered among all participants one year after completion of the group sessions. Discussion: We expect to gain insights into the role of municipalities in addressing perinatal health inequities, learn more about the interaction between different key stakeholders, and identify barriers and facilitators for a cross-sectoral approach to perinatal health. This knowledge will serve to inform the development of approaches to perinatal health inequities in areas with relatively poor perinatal health outcomes, both in the Netherlands and abroad.

TI  - Bolstering responsible management education through the sustainable development goals: Three perspectives
T2  - MANAGEMENT LEARNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Acknowledging the roles and responsibilities of business in society and the importance of realizing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), contemporary management education is characterized by the integration of a rich palette of initiatives in the field of Responsible Management Education (RME). It is important though to recognize that these initiatives, however laudable, so far represent rather basic, and thus insufficient, ways of truly integrating sustainability into management education. This Provocation to Debate essay therefore identifies three perspectives for bolstering RME through the SDGs: (1) addressing the fact that SDGs incorporate trade-offs, tensions, and paradoxes; (2) realizing the SGDs implies engaging in systemic activism; and (3) embracing the SDGs comes with emotional affect. As such, this essay is an invitation to critically reflect on the roles and contents of management education in spurring sustainable development and to engage in a meaningful discussion about the value and the limitations of the SDGs for advancing the RME agenda.

TI  - Hybrid infrastructures: The role of strategy and compromise in grassroot governance
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Contemporary trajectories of unsustainability and injustice require a profound restructuring of political, economic, and cultural institutions not sufficiently reflected in top-down governance. Diverse bottom-up actors and organizations that attempt to practice and institute more sustainable and just relations, in turn, have to tackle unfavorable conditions and generally lack the resources to take full effect. This paper critically discusses the role of strategy and compromise in facing this cycle of institutional inertia and lack of bottom-up agency. To illustrate its argument, the paper draws on an ethnographic case study on community-led initiatives in Stuttgart (Germany). It traces the ways in which a particular arrangement-an "open workshop"-supports individuals and organizations in their engagement in sustainability-oriented activities while substantiating ethically and socially ambiguous practices. Building on these empirical insights, the paper develops a notion of strategy that revolves around the reflective construction of hybrid but transformative infrastructures to strike a balance between ethical congruency and transformative pragmatism.

TI  - Methodological framework for identifying sustainability intervention priority areas on coastal landscapes and its application in China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In regional sustainability evaluation and policy analysis, the paradigm of safe operating spaces (SOS) has been widely applied. Yet, SOS is not readily useful for informing policy interventions toward sustainability transition. This study reports on a methodological framework that operationalizes SOS at the regional scale for designing spatially targeted sustainability interventions. In particular, this framework accounts for teleology by integrating policy orientations of the place-variant "major function" of development, and provides early-warnings by integrating long-term social-environmental trends. The framework we proposed has been applied by the Chinese government in a coastal province (Liaoning) for a landscape sustainability project, which is introduced here step-by-step. The four main steps include: (1) Quantifying SOS status across multiple "what to sustain" dimensions, e.g., land scarcity, water scarcity, pollutant discharge, and ecosystem health for the inland, and coastal exploitation intensity, marine environmental quality, and marine ecosystem biodiversity for the sea. (2) Quantifying SOS status in terms of the place-variant "what to develop" dimensions, e.g., urbanization-oriented, agriculture-stock-oriented, versus conservation-oriented development. (3) Integrating the two as a composite indicator of three ordinal levels to classify the current SOS status. (4) Developing a multi-level sustainability early-warning system by cross-analysis of the SOS status and social-environmental interaction trends (e.g., changes in, e.g., resource utilization efficiency, pollutant discharge, and eco-environmental quality). The potential use of the framework is demonstrated through the case of Liaoning Province, China, which helps policymakers to identify priority areas for Sustainability interventions. Methodological robustness and future directions of applying this multi-level sustainability early-warning system are further discussed. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Blue green infrastructure, from niche to mainstream: Challenges and opportunities for planning in Stockholm
T2  - TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The need for a transformation from conventional rainwater drainage systems towards Blue Green Infrastructure systems, designed as open spatial systems for sustainable rainwater management, is acknowledged. However, these systems are viewed as sociotechnical systems and, consequently, this transition has been slow. This paper focuses on the planning processes behind Blue Green Infrastructure projects in Stockholm and analyse them as transition experiments, addressing the question: what challenges and opportunities can be identified to enable the new systems to become a common component of rainwater management practices? Based on a literature review, this paper presents a methodological framework by identifying the key factors for facilitating or blocking sociotechnical change. These cluster around six categories ?? context, actors, instruments, processes, outputs and outcomes, and impacts. The paper used the framework to collect data and analyse three urban projects. Stockholm has remarkable strengths associated with moving towards new solutions, in terms of receptive contexts, human agency, space for experimentation, and a collaborative planning culture. However, there is a need for renegotiating the positional power of the actors involved in the planning systems in order to provide opportunities for water professionals to establish a stronger role in fitting the new solutions into the overall landscape, and urban planning processes and goals.

TI  - Contributing to sustainable and just energy systems? The mainstreaming of renewable energy prosumerism within and across institutional logics
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Renewable energy (RE) prosumerism comes with promises and expectations of contributing to sustainable and just energy systems. In its current process of becoming mainstream, numerous challenges and doubts have arisen whether it will live up to these. Building on insights from sustainability transitions research and institutional theory, this article unpacks the mainstreaming by considering the range of institutional arrangements and logics through which these contributions might be secured. Taking a Multi-actor Perspective, it analyses the differences, combinations, and tensions between institutional logics, associated actor roles and power relations. Firstly, it unpacks how mainstreaming occurs through mechanisms of bureaucratisation and standardisation (state logic), marketisation and commodification (market logic), as well as socialisation and communalisation (community logic). Secondly, it highlights the concomitant hybridisation of institutional logics and actor roles. Such hybrid institutional arrangements try to reconcile not only the more known trade-offs and tensions between for-profit/non-profit logics (regarding the distribution of benefits for energy activities and resources), but also between formal/informal logics (gaining recognition) and public/private logics (delineating access). This institutional concreteness moves the scholarly discussion and policy debate beyond idealistic discussions of ethical principles and abstract discussions about power: Simplistic framings of 'prosumerism vs incumbents' are dropped in favour of a critical discussion of hybrid institutional arrangements and their capacity to safeguard particular transformative ideals and normative commitments.

TI  - Beyond Supporting Access to Land in Socio-Technical Transitions. How Polish Grassroots Initiatives Help Farmers and New Entrants in Transitioning to Sustainable Models of Agriculture
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of agri-food systems for global sustainability calls for researching and advancing socio-technical transitions towards environmentally friendly models of farming. These transitions hinge on many prerequisites, one of which is providing access to land for farmers and new entrants who experiment with sustainable farming models. However, for socio-technical transitions in farming to be viable, access to land should be complemented with securing access to "intangible" resources such as skills, knowledge or networks. It seems that increasingly often these resources are being provided by various grassroots initiatives. The goal of this paper is to identify how the strategies employed by grassroots initiatives support farmers and new entrants in transitioning to sustainable farming models. In order to answer that question, we perform case studies of three Polish initiatives-Agro-Perma-Lab, PermaKultura.Edu.PL and the Ecological Folk High School in Grzybow-active in promoting agroecology, permaculture and organic farming. The results show a diversity of strategies employed by these initiatives that reflect the frameworks in which they operate. Considering these strategies from the perspective of transition studies suggests that they can be replicated in other contexts and potentially contribute to advancing socio-technical transitions of agri-food systems.

TI  - Application of Multi-Actor Multi-Criteria Analysis for Transition Management in Energy Communities
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Energy communities (ECs) play a role in the transition towards a low-carbon economy by 2050 and receive increasing attention from stakeholders within the energy sector. To foster ECs, transition management (TM) is a promising managerial approach to steer and guide the transition towards more sustainable practices. However, TM lacks a consistent methodology that addresses the criticism of the current application. To investigate what a structured and replicable TM approach for ECs can look like, this paper applies the multi-actor multi-criteria analysis (MAMCA), a participative multi-criteria decision method, to a case study EC in the Netherlands involving various stakeholders. The impact of the application on power relations, the political sphere, sustainability conceptualization, guidance of transitions, and representation was analyzed. MAMCA was found useful for multi-stakeholder settings seen in potential ECs, offering a unifying methodology for the practical application of TM. In the EC setting, the added value of MAMCA within TM lies more in the social representation, insight into stakeholder viewpoints, and communication rather than in final decision-making.

TI  - Sustainable Development Goals and Education: A Bibliometric Mapping Analysis
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda sets out 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aimed at improving life in all its dimensions, covering all sectors, with a particular emphasis on education. The study presented here focuses on universities as priority organisations and agents of change within the sphere of their social commitment. We thus conducted an analysis of the related scientific production as well as a bibliometric mapping, identifying the main publications indexed in the Web of Science, within its main collection. Focusing on scientific production, we examine the types of documents published, the evolution of the number of publications, the countries of origin of the publications, the most cited sources and articles, together with the most productive authors and a co-citation analysis. Regarding the bibliometric mapping analysis, the five core clusters included in the study were: SDGs in general; SDG 4 on Quality Education; Education for Sustainable Development; Higher Education; and Education Management. Among the main conclusions reached, we would emphasise the need for a change in role and function of university education to tackle sustainable development.

TI  - A participatory systems mapping approach for sustainability transitions: Insights from an experience in the tourism sector in Portugal
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of participatory modelling approaches in sustainability transition studies has been limited despite its potential contributions to transitions research. In this article, a methodological framework was designed based on a Participatory Systems Mapping (PSM) approach to structure and frame sustainability problems in transition management processes. The framework comprises three phases: 1) transition framing and actor selection, 2) PSM transition workshop, and 3) synthesis and evaluation. In a case study of the Portuguese tourism sector, participants created a shared systems view of tourism sustainability issues, based on the development of causal loop diagrams. Transition concepts, such as landscape-regime and niche-regime interactions, are specified in the diagrams. The PSM approach also provided a collaborative platform for cocreation of shared sustainability visions, thus fostering formalisation of a broad madmap for desired transition pathways.

TI  - The political dimension in environmental education curricula: Towards an integrative conceptual and analytical framework
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The risk of neutralizing the political dimension in environmental education through the depoliticization of its thematic objects, its intended learning, and its educational purposes, is a curricular phenomenon identified by recent research in the field. The aim of this article is to develop a conceptual and analytical framework to identify clarification of the political dimension. The framework on the political dimension as part of environmental education provides political learning entry that help to avoid the vanishing of this dimension. Nevertheless, this is not without themes and cannot be decoupled from its educational aims. Therefore, establishing a conceptual and analytical framework considering environmental themes, political learning and educational purposes together can effectively support the curricular construction of environmental education's political dimension. Thus, we define six environmental issue meta-themes by politicization and depoliticization trends that cross them; draw on environmental and political education research to identify political learning components in an environmental education context; and discuss linking political learning to possible educational purposes. We believe that within the dialectic of politicization/depoliticization that crosses the thematic subjects, learning and purposes of environmental education's political dimension, the path leading to the democratic subjectification of learners guarantees its non-neutralization.

TI  - Articulating the effect of food systems innovation on the Sustainable Development Goals
T2  - LANCET PLANETARY HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Food system innovations will be instrumental to achieving multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, major innovation breakthroughs can trigger profound and disruptive changes, leading to simultaneous and interlinked reconfigurations of multiple parts of the global food system. The emergence of new technologies or social solutions, therefore, have very different impact profiles, with favourable consequences for some SDGs and unintended adverse side-effects for others. Stand-alone innovations seldom achieve positive outcomes over multiple sustainability dimensions. Instead, they should be embedded as part of systemic changes that facilitate the implementation of the SDGs. Emerging trade-offs need to be intentionally addressed to achieve true sustainability, particularly those involving social aspects like inequality in its many forms, social justice, and strong institutions, which remain challenging. Trade-offs with undesirable consequences are manageable through the development of well planned transition pathways, careful monitoring of key indicators, and through the implementation of transparent science targets at the local level.

TI  - Transdisciplinary sustainability research in real-world labs: success factors and methods for change
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The transdisciplinary research mode has gained prominence in the research on and for sustainability transformations. Yet, solution-oriented research addressing complex sustainability problems has become complex itself, with new transdisciplinary research formats being developed and tested for this purpose. Application of new formats offers learning potentials from experience. To this end, we accompanied fourteen research projects conceptualized as real-world labs (RwLs) from 2015 to 2018. RwLs were part of a funding program on 'Science for Sustainability' in the German federal state of Baden-Wurttemberg. Here, we combine conceptual and empirical work to a structured collection of experiences and provide a comprehensive account of RwLs. First, we outline characteristics of RwLs as transformation oriented, transdisciplinary research approach, using experiments, enabling learning and having a long-term orientation. Second, we outline eleven success factors and concrete design notes we gained through a survey of the 14 RwLs: (1) find the right balance between scientific and societal aims, (2) address the practitioners needs and restrictions, (3) make use of the experimentation concept, (4) actively communicate, (5) develop a 'collaboration culture', (6) be attached to concrete sites, (7) create lasting impact and transferability, (8) plan for sufficient time and financial means, (9) adaptability, (10) research-based learning, and (11) recognize dependency on external actors. Characteristics and success factors are combined to illustrate practical challenges in RwLs. Third, we show which methods could be used to cope with challenges in RwLs. We conclude discussing the state of debate on RwLs and outline future avenues of research.

TI  - IMPACTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON TOURISM IN OURO PRETO - MG
T2  - ANAIS BRASILEIROS DE ESTUDOS TURISTICOS-ABET
M3  - Article
AB  - The year 2020 markedly became a period of major changes in human history. The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus, COVID- 19, created an unprecedented economic crisis, ocausing a temporary halt in several activities worldwide and a movement to reflect on new ways of creating more responsible and innovative tourism. In view of this scenario, the present work seeks to analyze the impacts, especially economic ones, arising from the pandemic of the new coronavirus on tourism in the municipality of Ouro Preto (MG). We opted for the appreciation of the lodging facilities segment due to its occupancy rate which reflects the flow of tourists in the locality. In order to achieve the proposed objective, interviews with semi-structured scripts, questionnaires, and the Tax Comparison of Service of Any Nature - TCSAN of the years 2018, 2019, and 2020 were collected from companies that performed the activity of hosting in the locality. Through this, it was possible to observe some reflexes of this impact, such as the lack of management for periods of crisis and the resumption without planning, resulting in an increase in the number of deaths and contaminated people.

TI  - Three Decades of Climate Mitigation: Why Haven't We Bent the Global Emissions Curve?
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES, VOL 46, 2021
M3  - Review
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Despite three decades of political efforts and a wealth of research on the causes and catastrophic impacts of climate change, global carbon dioxide emissions have continued to rise and are 60% higher today than they were in 1990. Exploring this rise through nine thematic lenses-covering issues of climate governance, the fossil fuel industry, geopolitics, economics, mitigation modeling, energy systems, inequity, lifestyles, and social imaginaries-draws out multifaceted reasons for our collective failure to bend the global emissions curve. However, a common thread that emerges across the reviewed literature is the central role of power, manifest in many forms, from a dogmatic political-economic hegemony and influential vested interests to narrow techno-economic mindsets and ideologies of control. Synthesizing the various impediments to mitigation reveals how delivering on the commitments enshrined in the Paris Agreement now requires an urgent and unprecedented transformation away from today's carbon- and energy-intensive development paradigm.

TI  - Identifying Combination of Controllable Metrics of Responsible Tourism in COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond: A Recovery Charter
T2  - NMIMS MANAGEMENT REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The trans-global pandemic inflicted by the novel corona virus, or COVID-19, has induced a stagnancy in the travel, tourism and hospitality industry. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), at present, are the only prophylactic measures resorted to as the travellers' community awaits a post-pandemic new normal. With the rising intervention of human species with natural environment, there has been an observed increase in the novelty and virulence of pathogens. The industry and the academia posit a rise in sensible travel and responsible travel behaviour in postpandemic period with new norms and protocols. However, the grounded tourism industry had to walk a tightrope in balancing profitability with responsibility while recovering from the pandemic-inflicted shock. The industry and its operators need to identify the controllable metrics of responsible tourism that might be used to propagate a viable recovery charter. Researchers have drawn on political and behavioural economics to offer an integrated sustainability-responsibility model consisting of three phases, namely, awareness, agenda and action. Such models propagated the concept of socio-environmental value-driven responsible tourism. However, the relationship between the controllable issues in responsible tourism and the socio-environmental key performance indicators remained unexplored. This study explored the said relationship using the Temporal Causal Modelling (TCM) approach. TCM uses an autoregressive approach to build a causal model for a specified set of target series from a set of candidate inputs. Unlike the conventional time series, modelling TCM does not use an explicit predictor. The study identified a number of controllable metrics and further gathered evidence on impact of controllable metrics on socio-environmental key performance indicators. The study is significant from the industry point of view as the tourism industry attempts to gather insights into the possible policy prescripts for post COVID- 19 recovery and sustenance.

TI  - A System Innovation Perspective on the Potential for Scaling Up New Psychological Interventions for Refugees
T2  - INTERVENTION-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH PSYCHOSOCIAL WORK AND COUNSELLING IN AREAS OF ARMED CONFLICT
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, a range of brief protocolised psychological interventions like Problem Management Plus have been developed. Such "scalable psychological interventions" are meant to be delivered by nonspecialists which can greatly increase access to psychological therapies for people affected by adversity, including forced displacement. However, embedding new interventions into mainstream practices is challenging. Novel interventions can remain in the research phase for a long time or stop altogether, which minimises their intended impact and reach. In this conceptual paper we propose a "system innovation perspective" on scaling up new psychological interventions for refugees and argue that existing mental health systems often need to change to integrate new interventions in a sustainable way. We present a conceptual framework, which includes ideas on cycles of deepening (learning by doing), broadening (repeating and linking), and scaling up (embedding) and the multilevel and constellation perspective. This framework has been operationalised in our scalability research as part of the STRENGTHS study in which we increase our understanding of the opportunities for scaling up four new psychological interventions in eight countries hosting Syrian refugees, including in Europe (Germany, Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland) and the Middle East (Egypt, Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon).

TI  - Science-Driven Societal Transformation, Part III: Design
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change, biodiversity loss, and other major social and environmental problems pose severe risks. Progress has been inadequate and scientists, global policy experts, and the general public increasingly conclude that transformational change is needed across all sectors of society in order to improve and maintain social and ecological wellbeing. At least two paths to transformation are conceivable: (1) reform of and innovation within existing societal systems (e.g., economic, legal, and governance systems); and (2) the de novo development of and migration to new and improved societal systems. This paper is the final in a three-part series of concept papers that together outline a novel science-driven research and development program aimed at the second path. It summarizes literature to build a narrative on the topic of de novo design of societal systems. The purpose is to raise issues, suggest design possibilities, and highlight directions and questions that could be explored in the context of this or any R&D program aimed at new system design. This paper does not present original research, but rather provides a synthesis of selected ideas from the literature. Following other papers in the series, a society is viewed as a superorganism and its societal systems as a cognitive architecture. Accordingly, a central goal of design is to improve the collective cognitive capacity of a society, rendering it more capable of achieving and sustainably maintaining vitality. Topics of attention, communication, self-identity, power, and influence are discussed in relation to societal cognition and system design. A prototypical societal system is described, and some design considerations are highlighted.

TI  - Creating a National Urban Research and Development Platform for Advancing Urban Experimentation
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Transformative changes are required for a 21st century sustainable urban development transition involving multiple interconnected domains of energy, water, transport, waste, and housing. This will necessitate a step change in performance goals and tangible solutions. Regenerative urban development has emerged as a major pathway, together with decarbonisation, climate adaptation involving new blue-green infrastructures, and transition to a new green, circular economy. These grand challenges are all unlikely to be realised with current urban planning and governance systems within a time frame that can mitigate environmental, economic, and social disruption. A new national platform for urban innovation has been envisaged and implemented in Australia that is capable of enabling engagement of multiple stakeholders across government, industry, and community as well as real time synchronous collaboration, visioning, research synthesis, experimentation, and decision-making. It targets large strategic metropolitan, mission-scale transition challenges as well as more tactical neighbourhood-scale projects. This paper introduces the iHUB: National Urban Research and Development Platform, its underlying concepts, and multiple layers of technical (IT/AV), software/analytical, data, and engagement, as envisioned and implemented in Australia's four largest capital cities and five collaborating foundation universities.

TI  - Sustainability-oriented labs in real-world contexts: An exploratory review
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - There are growing claims that meaningfully engaging with complex sustainability challenges requires change of a systemic nature. In governing transitions to sustainability, laboratories in real world contexts are growing in presence and promise. Yet, they span an array of contexts, conceptualisations and cases, making it difficult to find and relate labs across disciplines. Moreover, it is unclear how these labs vary in their approaches to sustainability, the importance of which has been voiced by the sustainability transitions community. In addressing these concerns, we adopted the broad research question: How can sustainability-oriented labs in real-world contexts be understood? We systematically reviewed 53 labs from disparate fields of research that broadly share a focus on sustainability. Through a mixed-methods analysis, we present three levels of results. Firstly, we provide an overview of the diversity in distribution, thematic focus and setup of labs. Secondly, we trace 7 different research communities where sustainability-oriented labs have been conceptualized (Living, Urban Living, Real-world, Evolutionary Learning, Urban Transition, Change and Transformation labs). Thirdly, we identify three key dimensions of labs, space, process and organisation, enabling a structured understanding of lab approaches towards sustainability. We then situate our results within salient transitions research areas, namely transition geographies, governance and innovation. In concluding, we point towards fruitful avenues for future research, capable of 1) unpacking lab approaches to sustainability as a dynamic normative property, and 2) providing a basis for complementary case-based comparison.

TI  - A leverage points perspective on social networks to understand sustainability transformations: evidence from Southern Transylvania
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainability transformations research increasingly recognizes the importance of local actors and their networks to foster fundamental societal change. Local actors have different types of relations between each other (e.g., sharing material resources, giving advice) through which they jointly intervene in different system characteristics. We conducted social network analyses of 32 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) who drive initiatives to foster sustainability in Southern Transylvania, Romania. In so doing, we applied a leverage points perspective by differentiating between relations according to the system characteristic they address, such as the parameters, feedbacks, design and intent of the system. Additionally, we tested for differences of centrality metrics (i.e., weighted degree, betweenness, eigenvector) from NGOs that conduct different actions (i.e., amplification processes) to increase the impact of their sustainability initiatives. Our results reveal several NGOs that have central positions in their networks for intervening in both shallower (i.e., parameters and feedbacks) and deeper (i.e., design and intent of a system) system characteristics. We also identified NGOs that are only central for intervening in specific system characteristics. In addition, we found that specific groups of amplification processes (i.e., amplifying within and out) are associated with the NGOs' positions in the parameters, feedbacks, and design networks. We conclude that the leverage points perspective in social network analysis has the potential to identify key actors and shed light on the attributes of local actors for intervening in shallower and deeper system characteristics to foster sustainability transformations.

TI  - Planetary just transition? How inclusive and how just?
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Planetary justice (PJ) requires a profound planetary just transition (PJT). Recognizing the essentially contested nature of just transition (JT) we propose an analytical scheme to better interpret and differentiate amongst the growing number of JT proposals and, by extension, PJTs. After outlining the increasing association of JT proposals with global policy, as well as their proliferation, we employ scale to address their spatial and temporal inclusiveness and scope to address their social and ecological inclusiveness. Assuming that inclusion does not automatically translate into procedural or substantive justice we then propose that JT proposals should also be evaluated in terms of their socioecological purpose, specifically social equality and standing for nature. We then argue that a full understanding of JT must combine inclusiveness and justice and suggest ways in which we can advance the practice and study of Planetary Just Transition.

TI  - Change as a permanent condition: A history of transition processes in Dutch North Sea fisheries
T2  - MARINE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Centre of debate on food production in the Netherlands today focusses on the issue of realising a cyclical mode of production and operating in a climate neutral way. This transition is envisaged not only for agriculture, but also for fisheries. Dutch fisheries face a multitude of challenges in addition to, as well as related to this circularity transition. These include loss of operating space for fishing activities in the North Sea (windfarms, nature conservation areas, Brexit) and the need for further development of sustainable fishing methods and vessels (innovations to reduce ecological and environmental impacts). Whilst the Dutch fisheries face these challenges now and in the future, it has already gone through significant changes over the past 70 years. Since the dawn of fisheries policy in Europe in the 1970s, change and development have been part of the fishing industry, indicating that transitions and change are a permanent aspect of fisheries. From past transitions lessons can be learnt to take on current and future challenges. Past transitions in Dutch fisheries were analysed from the perspective of transition and governance. Based on literature and reports produced in recent decades and pooled knowledge gained from the fishing industry, government and environmental organisations, this paper shows that the roles of the different actors involved changed during past transitions, with a shift in playing field occurring from a regional to a European scale and that joint problem definition, collective sensemaking and a long term vision are essential in navigating transition waters.

TI  - Social identity as a key concept for connecting transformative societal change with individual environmental activism
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes social identity as a psychological concept that connects societal and individual aspects of transformation processes. To this end, we embed the social identity concept into the multilevel perspective, a framework frequently used for analysing societal transformation processes. The paper presents three meta-analyses summarizing the empirical evidence for the postulated strong pro-environmental social identity-proenvironmental collective action link. A first meta-analysis (nine samples) finds a pooled correlation of r+ = .63 between pro-environmental social identity and intention to participate in pro-environmental collective action. This finding is replicated in a second meta-analysis, which shows a correlation of r+ = 0.56 (15 samples). The third meta-analysis supports that pro-environmental social identity is a stronger predictor of collective pro-environmental action than of individual pro-environmental private-sphere behavior (r+ = 0.35; eight samples). We discuss implications of these findings for further research and highlight power and ideology as additional transformation-oriented psychological constructs.

TI  - Exploring incumbents' agency: Institutional work by grid operators in decentralized energy innovations
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The agency of incumbents has gained increasing attention in the study of transitions. Recent studies show that besides being inert and resistant to change, incumbents can also support transitions. We focus on the agency of a particular type of incumbent, grid operators. In several countries, these actors play an active role in institutional change in the energy domain. At the same time, they are engaging in activities to maintain the regime. This paper examines the actions of grid operators when performing institutional work, i.e. when creating, maintaining and disrupting institutions. We conducted a qualitative content analysis of Dutch media to analyze the actions of grid operators while engaging with decentralized energy innovations. We conclude that grid operators are both subject and object of institutional work as part of a distributed, collective process of institutional change. Furthermore, our analysis reflects on their paradoxical position as embedded actors engaging in institutional change.

TI  - A practical tool for analyzing socio-technical transitions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding socio-technical transitions, let alone managing them, is complicated. This is especially the case for many practitioners, who are commonly not well-versed in the language of transition studies but deal with transition problems on a daily basis. To make the academic knowledge on socio-technical transitions available to practitioners, we introduce the transition model canvas (TMC) as a tool for systematically mapping the key elements, and their interactions, of socio-technical transitions. Based on the business model canvas (BMC) from entrepreneurship and the multi-level perspective (MLP) from transition studies, the TMC is an accessible tool that allows transition practitioners, students, and educators to evaluate and accelerate socio-technical transitions. The proposed canvas also helps further diffuse transition thinking into society and improve the quality of socio-technical policymaking and strategy development.

TI  - A limits-oriented adaptive approach for strategic environmental assessment
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the face of global environmental change, decision-makers need effective environmental assessments to shape policies and plans aiming at sustainable human development. In this paper, we propose a new approach to address the needs of Strategic Environmental Assessment. We develop a Limits-Oriented Adaptive framework that is useful not only to recognize and address existing SEA problems (its limits), but also to incorporate elements of social and institutional uncertainty. This framework conceptualizes the need to first identify existing SEA limitations (e.g. procedural, legislative) through learning loops, and then to address them with incremental or transformative change through adaptive cycles. The first part of this paper presents existing frameworks of adaptive policy-making, adaptive management and loops of learning that can contribute shaping better environmental assessments. In the second part, we present our framework and we illustrate how the contributions from different disciplines relate to the procedural and technical sides of Strategic Environmental Assessment. Last, we present the results of the experimental application of our method in an Australian and an Italian case study. We then discuss our findings, outlining how SEA can learn from adaptive management to overcome its limitations and to embrace incremental and transformational change. We fie these lessons to the needs of different groups of SEA professionals, developers, legislators, and the broad public.

TI  - Evaluating development path changes using a novel climate action assessment framework in three municipalities in British Columbia, Canada
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - To transition to a more sustainable and low-carbon economy, a series of local governments in British Columbia, Canada, are implementing climate action and innovation. This is largely in response to a need for societal changes in current development paths. However, there has been a lack of studies assessing the effectiveness of these actions and whether these municipalities are on track to meet their targets. This paper tests a newly developed assessment framework to evaluate local government actions and to better understand city-wide community development paths in three major cities in British Columbia-Vancouver, Victoria and Surrey. This assessment reveals notable progress in their transitions to sustainable pathways in areas such as agenda setting and strategy, plan formulation and implementation, and these sometimes result in transformative actions. Nonetheless, a gap between these actions and their performance reveals that local governments from this study are failing to properly address the current climate emergency. In particular, the municipalities lack processes for evaluating their progress in changing their current paths. This reduces their capacity to identify best practices to improve the effectiveness of climate actions and also hinders their ability to act on feedback and make adjust-ments to meet their stated goals and targets.

TI  - Climate action assessment in three small municipalities in British Columbia: advancements vis-a-vis major neighboring cities
T2  - CURRENT RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper applied a recently developed Local Government Climate Action Assessment Framework to identify whether small municipalities in British Columbia are on track to meet their climate targets and to better understand the effectiveness of their climate-related actions. The aim of this paper was (1) to further test the assessment framework by evaluating its applicability for smaller municipalities, (2) to evaluate and categorize local progress in three small cities, namely Campbell River, Prince George and Revelstoke, and (3) to contrast these climate actions with actions taken by larger municipalities in BC, using the same assessment framework. This assessment revealed that key external support made available to expand on their Integrated Community Sustainability Plans provided for striking similarities among the three case studies regarding their strategies and plan formulations for which actions were largely transformative or reformative. However, the three small cities were lacking periodic reporting and monitoring of actions and presented shorter timeframes of up to 20-50 years for their planning horizons, all of which negatively impact their prioritization strategies. The main difference between larger and smaller cities was found among actions related to the feedback and evaluation category of the framework, with smaller cities performing more poorly. Greater shift in priorities away from climate change-related actions were evident in smaller local governments, signalling their more vulnerable position regarding changes in leadership in local and provincial administrations. This study highlights the key role that strategic alliances, networks, and external champions as partners play in planning and implementing climate action and in increasing public interest in sustainability. Thus, these should be fostered and promoted to keep building local capacity and effectively accelerate greater change through e.g., strengthening their capacity to implement, monitor and evaluate climate actions.

TI  - People in transitions: Energy citizenship, prosumerism and social movements in Europe
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Active energy citizens are leading energy transitions, co-producing new cultures, practices and structures of production and consumption. This article aims to understand if prosumerism - the collective participation of prosumers in energy projects with social, economic and environmental benefits to society - can be referred to as a social movement. The article draws on a review of Social Movements Theory and applies thematic analysis to characterize 46 prosumer initiatives in Europe. The collective identities, socio-political opponents, knowledge-making activities, collective learning, and collective action aspects of these prosumers are described. The results show that prosumer initiatives converge towards a transformative social movement. This movement upholds decentralized renewable energy production and consumption, and presents itself as a socially inclusive, transparent and participatory energy model, replicable across the globe, in what can be described as a collective action towards a decentralized democratic energy model. The discussion highlights relationships between prosumerism and framings such as energy justice (including energy poverty and gender issues), energy democracy, climate change action and anti-nuclear movements, to reach a conclusion considering the relevance of calling prosumerism a social movement, while opening up some avenues for future research.

TI  - When top-down meets bottom-up: Is there a collaborative business model for local energy storage?
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As the energy transition progresses, energy storage becomes increasingly important for safeguarding a reliable energy provision. At the same time, energy storage systems are used to increase the self-consumption of decentralised generation and are expected to result in lower electricity bills for the energy prosumers. Drawing on sustainability transitions and management literature, this contribution focuses on a neighbourhood battery with the aim to explore to what extent a collaboration between a network operator and renewable energy initiatives on local energy storage could help increase the impact of the latter in the energy transition. The concept of a neighbourhood battery involves strategic decisions, and perhaps a strategic innovation, whose transformative potential depends to a large extent on the perceptions and actions of those involved. This paper explores the opportunities and constraints for a collaborative business model for the neighbourhood battery in the Netherlands, as well as the challenges and tensions that emerge for the main parties involved. The perspectives of the network operator were compared with those of renewable energy initiatives in the country, including the Energy Service Company involved in the pilot and, in parts, with the perspectives of the involved end-users. This contribution registers a misalignment of interests and expectations which complicates the deployment of the neighbourhood battery concept. Recognizing the critical role of network operators, the conditions that may enable the emergence of collaborative business models for local energy storage are also discussed.

TI  - Recurring droughts or social shifts? Exploring drivers of large-scale transformations in a transformed country
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - As climate change intensifies, the need for large-scale transformations that reform vulnerable systems' prevailing values and development pathways is increasingly recognized. However, there is limited understanding of the factors that underlie such changes. This study sheds light on these factors by examining the case of Israel - a largely arid to semi-arid country with highly scarce natural water resources and a historical rural-agricultural ideology. Adopting an historically-informed systems perspective, I analyze two transformations that diminished Israel's vulnerability to recurring droughts: the 1960s' economic transformation from agriculture to industry, and the shift to seawater desalination in the mid-2000s. These changes are examined using causal-loop diagrams based on multiple data sources, including archival records, statistical reports and a systematic review of grey and academic literature.The findings show that both transformations, instigated by state institutions during exceptionally severe droughts, were driven by shifts away from development paradigms embedded in the nation-building ideology, as well as by social stresses that exceeded the natural limits of the agricultural system and water supply system. Repeated drought shocks activated and later reactivated the shift to desalination, intended to a certain degree to reduce drought vulnerability. However, drought did not significantly affect the economic transformation, initiated mainly due to saturation in agricultural development. Thus, I argue that alongside concerted adaptation efforts state institutions should dedicate greater attention to the management of broader social challenges and crises in a manner that fosters greater resilience against future climate changes. Ideological shifts and consequent restructuring of development paths, as well as the interaction between population growth and limited natural resources, may constitute important entry points. These entry points are particularly pertinent to emerging economies in other dry areas, many of which face similar social and economic trends to those experienced in Israel over the last decades.

TI  - Holding the ground. Alliances and defiances between scientists, policy-makers and civil society in the development of a voluntary initiative, the "4 per 1000: Soils for food security and climate"
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The proliferation of multistakeholder initiatives is deemed to be a key vehicle for the implementation of international agreements for sustainable development. This is the case with the "4 per 1000: Soils for Food Security and Climate" initiative (4PM), launched in March 2015 by French Minister Stephane Le Foll, whose aim is to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks worldwide, in order to simultaneously address climate change mitigation, adaptation, and food security issues. This paper explores the knowledge dynamics at play and the role scientists played in the early development of the initiative. It shows that the strong involvement of soil scientists in the design of 4 PM, as well as in the enrolment of other stakeholders, has had a dual consequence. On the one hand, it has reinforced the initiative's credibility by keeping most discussions at a mere technical level, considering soil organic carbon sequestration as the main (if not the sole) proxy for climate change mitigation, adaptation and food security. On the other hand, this technical approach has led the initiative to be hardly able to enrol representatives from peasant and familial agricultures, who have criticized the absence of clear definitions of the type of agricultural models the 4 PM intends to promote. We show that this has had detrimental consequences on the results of the 4 PM initiative, and we discuss the implications both for the framing of voluntary multistakeholder initiatives and for the engagement of scientists in such settings, notably in terms of their accountability.

TI  - Considering the Human-Dimension to Make Sustainable Transitions Actionable
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable innovation and transitions are increasingly gaining traction within academia, industries, and policymakers. Despite the research efforts, sustaining innovation and operationalizing transitions still remains a barely explored field. The pragmatic step from understanding towards doing is often not made explicit in the literature. In fact, it results in an unclear and vague grip on how to operationalize these understandings, or differently put on how to make this understanding pragmatic. In the current article, we conducted an integrative literature review using human-centeredness lenses that informs the so-called 'Human-Dimension' framework. We argue that adding the Human-Dimension to the existing models for analysis, such as the Multi-Level Perspective framework, might clarify the different meanings that emerge within the network of actors in a transition, and knowing how to translate those individual meanings towards a collective construction of meaning might be enabled. To illustrate the framework's contribution, we applied it to the context of a local sustainable development project. The results show how human-centeredness could serve as a domain to make the Human-Dimension of sustainable transitions actionable.

TI  - Ensuring a Post-COVID Economic Agenda Tackles Global Biodiversity Loss
T2  - ONE EARTH
M3  - Review
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused dramatic and unprecedented impacts on both global health and economies. Many governments are now proposing recovery packages to get back to normal, but the 2019 Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Global Assessment indicated that business as usual has created widespread ecosystem degradation. Therefore, a post-COVID world needs to tackle the economic drivers that create ecological disruptions. In this perspective, we discuss a number of tools across a range of actors for both short-term stimulus measures and longer-term revamping of global, national, and local economies that take biodiversity into account. These include measures to shift away from activities that damage biodiversity and toward those supporting ecosystem resilience, including through incentives, regulations, fiscal policy, and employment programs. By treating the crisis as an opportunity to reset the global economy, we have a chance to reverse decades of biodiversity and ecosystem losses.

TI  - Goal-Driven or Data-Driven? Inventory of Sustainability Indicator Initiatives in Rural Canada
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article seeks to address knowledge gaps on sustainability indicators (SIs) in rural and natural resource-dependent communities, considering how they are used to contextualize sustainable development priorities and support local governance. We build on recent scholarship on the potentials of SIs for stimulating societal transformation, extending this inquiry into rural and resource-based communities which have been under-represented in SI research. The governance challenges facing rural Canada, as well as its geographic and socio-economic diversity, provide a unique context for examining these issues. We provide relatively uncommon synthetic findings by compiling an inventory of SI initiatives across 39 rural communities and regions of Canada. Using the Community Capital Framework, we examine grey literature and academic publications related to each initiative spanning from 1999-2019 to determine the breadth of sustainable development priorities considered. Informed by collaborative and multi-level governance frameworks, we explore how these initiatives are used to support multi-stakeholder collective action. This article finds that rural Canadian SI initiatives prioritize socio-cultural capital, with relatively fewer economic and ecological indicators, while identifying a typology of SI use and inter-related governance dynamics informing how these priorities and indicators are determined. Although some initiatives display highly collaborative and bottom-up processes, many rural Canadian SI initiatives are characterized by a data-driven approach that, when met with local capacity gaps, fails to contextualize standardized datasets to reflect rural realities. We encourage more in-depth investigation of these findings and comparison of Canadian experiences to other jurisdictions.

TI  - How can policy processes remove barriers to sustainable food systems in Europe? Contributing to a policy framework for agri-food transitions
T2  - FOOD POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - A new food policy coherent with the goal of achieving sustainable food systems implies changing visions and radically revising the understanding of the system on which agricultural and food-related policies act. This paper identifies and discusses policy processes that contribute to sustainable food systems in Europe. Based on a conceptual framework that links the policy cycle approach to transition theories, we (i) assess the evolution of policy cycles of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) to highlight how the food and nutrition concepts have evolved and been reframed throughout the five phases of the CAP, (ii) map and classify available policy instruments to assess potential synergies and gaps in view of their reorganization and (iii) indicate and discuss strategic tools for sustainable food policies. This contribution goes beyond the current literature highlighting the obstacles which hinder the transition to a policy regime that embodies the nexus among food and nutrition security, natural capital preservation and climatic and social justice, and proposing new avenues for food policy studies.

TI  - Science-Driven Societal Transformation, Part II: Motivation and Strategy
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change, biodiversity loss, and other well-known social and environmental problems pose grave risks. Progress has been insufficient, and as a result, scientists, global policy experts, and the general public increasingly conclude that bold change is required. At least two kinds of bold change are conceivable: reform of existing societal systems (e.g., financial, economic, and governance systems), including their institutions, policies, and priorities; and transformation, understood here as the de novo development of and migration to new and improved systems. The latter has barely been explored in the scientific literature and is the focus of this concept paper. The main theses explored are that transformation is prudent, given risks, attractive, given potential benefits, and achievable, given political, social, and financial constraints. A body of literature is cited in support, but that body is necessarily small given the novelty of the topic. In particular, there are almost no papers in the scientific literature addressing the "how to?" of transformation, a central theme of this paper. Thus, this paper serves in part to raise topics and bring attention to possibilities and new directions.

TI  - Learning Processes in the Early Development of Sustainable Niches: The Case of Sustainable Fashion Entrepreneurs in Mexico
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - There are still several gaps to bridge in learning and sustainability transition research, one of which is the empirical exploration of learning processes and outcomes involved in the formation and development of sustainability niches. The purpose of this study is to investigate the formation and development of a sustainability niche through the lenses of individual and social transformative learning, specifically the learning processes and outcomes. We conducted a qualitative exploratory multi-case study of six different projects participating in the sustainable fashion and textiles niche in Mexico. We used documentation and individual interviews (n = 7) to collect evidence of the learning process in the formation and development of this niche. We used transformative learning theory to guide the analysis of the learning phenomena occurring in the development of this niche, distinguishing three main phases where individual learning takes place in the first two and social learning in the third. Analytical elements such as prior learning, disorienting dilemmas, action engagement and network building figure prominently in the learning process and outcomes in the development of the sustainable fashion niche in Mexico. This work provides a better and more detailed understanding of the multi-level perspective model through exploring sub-levels within the niche level, by shedding light on the importance of individual and social learning in the development of sustainable niches.

TI  - The diffusion of circular services: Transforming the Dutch catering sector
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Alternative ways to provide services based on circular economy principles are facing the problem of diffusing beyond local experimentations in niches to become mainstream. This is the entry point for our case study examining niche experimentation in the form of circular catering as developed within the urban living lab BlueCity010 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and how it interacted with incumbent actors. This case sets itself against the background of the national policy program "Circular Netherlands in 2050" and larger socio-political efforts to accelerate the transition to a circular economy in the Netherlands. Through a stakeholder analysis and in-person interviews, qualitative data was extracted that helped to map the process of diffusion, the inherent power dynamics, and connecting mechanisms between niche and current regime actors. The results detail various manners through which niche and regime actors connect, including actions taken to facilitate the diffusion of circular catering and settings that created a favorable environment. Our findings also include quantitative values for indicators of success from a Dutch ministry (e.g. CO2 emissions range, percent of animal protein, reduction of food waste), which appear in their very preliminary stage to be on track for meeting their circularity goals within catering. Our research offers novel empirical insights into how to increase and scale cleaner production practices towards a circular economy through circular startups, summarized into 15 observed principles for connecting and integrating niche innovations to incumbent practices. Lastly, these observed practices are discussed in connection to sustainability transitions and in terms of their potential generalizability to cleaner procurement. (C) 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Four approaches to anticipatory climate governance: Different conceptions of the future and implications for the present
T2  - WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Review
AB  - In times of accelerating earth system transformations and their potentially disruptive societal consequences, imagining and governing the future is now a core challenge for sustainability research and practice. Much social science and sustainability science scholarship increasingly engages with the future. There is, however, a lack of scrutiny of how the future is envisioned in these literatures, and with what implications for governance in the present. This article analyses these two aspects, building on the concept of "anticipatory governance." We understand anticipatory governance to broadly meangoverning in the present to adapt to or shape uncertain futures. We review perspectives within public policy, futures studies, social-ecological systems, environmental policy and governance, transition studies, science and technology studies, and responsible research and innovation literatures. All these literatures engage explicitly or implicitly with the notion of anticipatory governance, yet from distinct ontological and epistemological starting points. Through our review, we identifyfour approachesto anticipatory governance that differ with regard to (a) their conceptions of and engagement with the future; (b) their implications foractions to be taken in the present; and (c) theultimate endto be realized through anticipatory governance. We then map onto these four approaches a diverse set of methods and tools of anticipation that each engages with. In concluding, we discuss how these four approaches provide a useful analytical lens through which to assess ongoingpracticesof anticipatory governance in the climate and sustainability realm.

TI  - Levers and leverage points for pathways to sustainability
T2  - PEOPLE AND NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Humanity is on a deeply unsustainable trajectory. We are exceeding planetary boundaries and unlikely to meet many international sustainable development goals and global environmental targets. Until recently, there was no broadly accepted framework of interventions that could ignite the transformations needed to achieve these desired targets and goals. As a component of the IPBES Global Assessment, we conducted an iterative expert deliberation process with an extensive review of scenarios and pathways to sustainability, including the broader literature on indirect drivers, social change and sustainability transformation. We asked, what are the most important elements of pathways to sustainability? Applying a social-ecological systems lens, we identified eight priority points for intervention (leverage points) and five overarching strategic actions and priority interventions (levers), which appear to be key to societal transformation. The eight leverage points are: (1) Visions of a good life, (2) Total consumption and waste, (3) Latent values of responsibility, (4) Inequalities, (5) Justice and inclusion in conservation, (6) Externalities from trade and other telecouplings, (7) Responsible technology, innovation and investment, and (8) Education and knowledge generation and sharing. The five intertwined levers can be applied across the eight leverage points and more broadly. These include: (A) Incentives and capacity building, (B) Coordination across sectors and jurisdictions, (C) Pre-emptive action, (D) Adaptive decision-making and (E) Environmental law and implementation. The levers and leverage points are all non-substitutable, and each enables others, likely leading to synergistic benefits. Transformative change towards sustainable pathways requires more than a simple scaling-up of sustainability initiatives-it entails addressing these levers and leverage points to change the fabric of legal, political, economic and other social systems. These levers and leverage points build upon those approved within the Global Assessment's Summary for Policymakers, with the aim of enabling leaders in government, business, civil society and academia to spark transformative changes towards a more just and sustainable world.A free Plain Language Summary can be found within the Supporting Information of this article.A free Plain Language Summary can be found within the Supporting Information of this article.

TI  - Stakeholder Perceptions of Policy Tools in Support of Sustainable Food Consumption in Europe: Policy Implications
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Transitioning agri-food systems towards increased sustainability and resilience requires that attention be paid to sustainable food consumption policies. Policy-making processes often require the engagement and acceptance of key stakeholders. This study analyses stakeholders' solutions for creating sustainable agri-food systems, through interviews with a broad range of stakeholders including food value chain actors, non-governmental organizations, governmental institutions, research institutions and academic experts. The study draws on 38 in-depth, semi-structured interviews conducted in four European countries: France, Iceland, Italy and the UK, as well as three interviews with high-level EU experts. The interviewees' solutions were analysed according to a five-category typology of policy tools, encompassing direct activity regulations, and market-based, knowledge-based, governance and strategic policy tools. Most of the identified solutions were located in the strategic tools category, reflecting shared recognition of the need to integrate food policy to achieve long-term goals. Emerging solutions-those which were most commonly identified among the different national contexts-were then used to derive empirically-grounded and more universally applicable recommendations for the advancement of sustainable food consumption policies.

TI  - Technocratic and deliberative governance for sustainability: rethinking the roles of experts, consumers, and producers
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
M3  - Article
AB  - While there is general consensus regarding the urgent need for sustainability transitions in food and agriculture, tensions exist regarding how to best stimulate and manage them. Generally, there are two competing agrifood governance models for advancing sustainability: technocratic and deliberative democratic procedures. Taking up Fischer's (Citizens, experts, and the environment: The politics of local knowledge, Duke University Press, Durham, 2000) call to develop new ways of bringing citizens and experts together in governance, this paper examines an integrative sustainability governance system that uses both technocratic and deliberative procedures. Drawing on a case study of a Japanese consumer cooperative, Seikatsu Club Consumer Cooperative, this paper analyzes the ways that technocratic and deliberative governance procedures use different forms of knowledge, measure and assess sustainability differently, and produce different outcomes. The analysis finds that whereas technocratic forms of governance are most effective at monitoring, verification, and compliance assurance, deliberative processes facilitate relationships, mutual understanding, and commitment among stakeholders. For sustainability governance to address not only the technical but also social dimensions of sustainability, the findings on Seikatsu Club Consumer Cooperative's integrative governance system support the need for deliberative procedures.

TI  - Municipal utilities and electric cooperatives in the United States: Interpretive frames, strategic actions, and place-specific transitions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Renewable energy and social justice advocates are organizing around the potential for community-based democratic organizations to promote more decentralized, sustainable, and just societies. Within this movement, consumer-owned electric utilities are often seen as central actors. Yet, there has been little systematic investigation into why integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) varies across these utilities. We explore this question using literature on sustainability transitions and strategic action fields. Choices about when and how to integrate DERs are shaped by new interpretations of long-standing principles, existing institutional relationships, and a utility's political power. We identify how four divergent strategies shape distinct technology configurations with differences in physical scale, concentration of political authority, and distribution of economic benefits. These differences suggest that local technology ownership may not be sufficient to motivate change in some contexts. Policy addressing political processes and ownership scale may be needed to accelerate more sustainable and just energy transitions.

TI  - A framework to explain the role of boundary objects in sustainability transitions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Our modern society is characterized by increasing diversity and complexity, leading to overwhelming challenges like climate change or environmental degradation. These problems are posing impracticable ethical dilemmas and conflicts of interest among an expanding range of institutional logics. While this cognitive, ideological, scientific, and political diversity can represent a major barrier for the collaborative work that sustainability transitions require, it is also a necessary resource for innovation and adaptation. It is then natural to wonder how diversity and collaboration among institutional logics can be accommodated and balanced. In this article, we develop a framework to explain the role of boundary objects in sustainability transitions (BOIST framework), which describes how ambiguous artefacts (boundary objects) can be deliberately employed by actors to drive transitions through bridging conflicting logics without constraining their diversity. The applicability of the framework is demonstrated with an in-depth case study of the Copenhagen municipality's transition to more sustainable stormwater management.

TI  - Relating financial systems to sustainability transitions: Challenges, demands and design features
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Paris Climate Agreement, Sustainable Development Goals and Addis Ababa Action Agenda call for the financial system to be "consistent and integrated" in its response to the sustainability and climate breakdown. Sustainability transitions research (STR) and orthodox finance literature are failing to engage with these calls. This paper offers three contributions to address this issue. Firstly, it scopes the sustainability-related finance literature and finds broad but fragmented research strands with limited critical analysis and little cross-engagement with STR. Secondly, the paper draws on insights from STR and international climate and sustainable development agreements to propose a transition demand framework that characterises the explicit demands that sustainability transitions place on the financial system (understood as intermediaries, markets and infrastructure). Thirdly, the paper considers essential design features for financial systems to meet the specific demands of sustainability transitions and identifies critical questions for broadening research in this area.

TI  - Transition topology: Capturing institutional dynamics in regional development paths to sustainability
T2  - RESEARCH POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - A key challenge in sustainability transitions research is to better understand the huge variety and spatial unevenness of transitions paths. Institutions and institutional change have been identified as critical issues, as regional institutional settings significantly influence the pace and scope of sustainability transitions. However, the complex institutional dynamics underpinning Regional Transition Paths to Sustainability' (RTPS) are not well understood. Underexplored is in particular the link between short time gradual changes on the micro-level and long-term transformative change on the system level. In order to add to a more profound understanding of these processes, a focus on organizational change is valuable. The basic argument made in this article is that the emergence of new temporary and more permanent forms of organization has the potential to enable de-institutionalization and new institutionalization processes simultaneously. As we will show, new organizational forms also serve as a means to make institutional dynamics visible. The contribution of this paper is thus twofold: By combining insights from sustainability transition theory, evolutionary economic geography and neoinstitutional organization theory, we develop an original conceptual framework. By developing and applying the methodological approach of a 'transition topology', the potential of this framework for comparative research on actors and processes in different regional transition path to sustainability is revealed.

TI  - Three principles for co-designing sustainability intervention strategies: Experiences from Southern Transylvania
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - Transformational research frameworks provide understanding and guidance for fostering change towards sustainability. They comprise stages of system understanding, visioning and co-designing intervention strategies to foster change. Guidance and empirical examples for how to facilitate the process of co-designing intervention strategies in real-world contexts remain scarce, especially with regard to integrating local initiatives. We suggest three principles to facilitate the process of co-designing intervention strategies that integrate local initiatives: (1) Explore existing and envisioned initiatives fostering change towards the desired future; (2) Frame the intervention strategy to bridge the gap between the present state and desired future state(s), building on, strengthening and complementing existing initiatives; (3) Identify drivers, barriers and potential leverage points for how to accelerate progress towards sustainability. We illustrate our approach via a case study on sustainable development in Southern Transylvania. We conclude that our principles were useful in the case study, especially with regards to integrating initiatives, and could also be applied in other real-world contexts.

TI  - Towards an integral perspective on leveraging sustainability transformations using the theory of modal aspects
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Engaging appropriately with sustainability transformations requires adopting an integral perspective on related system dynamics. This view underpins the sustainable development goals. Informing policy and decision making from a consistently integral perspective, however, remains a key challenge. To some extent, the leverage points approach has proved useful in doing so in terms of providing an encompassing view on related options for intervening in systems. There are, however, a number of points in which it needs to be complemented by other approaches to better address the need for an integral perspective on sustainability transformations as well as to better address the need for being able to articulate normative perspectives on transformation processes and outcomes. We argue that the theory of modal aspects is a good candidate for doing so. To illustrate its potential, we explore its characteristics, we illustrate its application opportunities in the analysis of sustainability in food systems transitions, we systematically compare leverage points and modal aspects, and close with an exploration of ways in which the leverage points approach and theory of modal aspects can be considered complementary perspectives. The authors conclude that the theory of modal aspects offers opportunities for enriching both the leverage points approach and wider approaches in sustainability transformations by offering a consistently integral perspective across scale levels, and by offering a number of ways of engaging with normativity in related processes without resorting to fixed political views. This articulates its potential for playing a useful role in related multi-stakeholder processes and sustainability governance.

TI  - Articulating the new urban water paradigm
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Urban water systems in industrialized countries have underpinned unprecedented improvements in urban living standards through effective drinking water supply, sanitation and drainage. However, conventional urban water systems are increasingly regarded as too rigid and not sufficiently resilient to confront growing social, technological and environmental complexity and uncertainty, manifested, for example, in the maladaptation to climate change, depletion of nonrenewable resources, and degrading urban livability. In response, a new urban water paradigm has emerged in the last two decades within the context of a broader societal change that promotes a more organic worldview over the classical mechanistic and technocratic understanding of reality. This article develops and applies an analytical framework to coherently describe the new paradigm and contrast it with the old urban water paradigm. The framework includes a philosophical foundation and set of methodological principles that shape the new paradigm's approach to governance, management, and infrastructure.

TI  - Exploring the barriers to freshwater policy implementation in New Zealand
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater policy is driven by interrelated challenges such as declining water quality, urban expansion, and agricultural intensification. But recent research indicates that implementation of policy is less successful than its development. Given recent innovations in New Zealand's freshwater management and policy, this paper asks,What are the barriers to freshwater policy implementation in New Zealand?Data for this research were gathered through semi-structured interviews with key regional council and unitary authority employees. The research discovered several implementation barriers, such as low government and community capacity and difficulty aligning local policy with national policy. The paper argues that a closed loop between problem identification and responding to problems through planning slows the implementation of freshwater policy. In response, the paper offers a set of recommendations, designed for the New Zealand context, to enable more effective implementation of freshwater policy.

M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, business models for environmental sustainability have gained increasing attention in the management field and among practitioners and stakeholders. This study aims to analyse the state of the art on the topic by reviewing the growing but mainly phenomenon-driven research. In particular, by identifying main research trends and relevant gaps in the literature and by providing future research avenues, this paper advances the debate on the need for alternative concepts of doing business that go beyond the creation of economic value for a company in a way that generates value for the society. Our article undertakes two stages of screening the available literature and selects 151 peer-reviewed articles published between 2007 and early 2019 for the review. The paper provides the first comprehensive systematic review of business models in the field of environmental sustainability with a detailed descriptive and critical analysis and with a discussion of future research opportunities.

TI  - Sustainability transformations: socio-political shocks as opportunities for governance transitions
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Faced with accelerating environmental challenges, research on social-ecological systems is increasingly focused on the need for transformative change towards sustainable stewardship of natural resources. This paper analyses the potential of rapid, large-scale socio-political change as a window of opportunity for transformative change of natural resources governance. We hypothesize that shocks at higher levels of social organization may open up opportunities for transformation of social-ecological systems into new pathways of development. However, opportunities need to be carefully navigated otherwise transformations may stall or lead the social-ecological system in undesirable directions. We investigate (i) under which circumstances socio-political change has been used by actors as a window of opportunity for initiating transformation towards sustainable natural resource governance, (ii) how the different levels of the systems (landscape, regime and niche) interact to pave the way for initiating such transformations and (iii) which key features (cognitive, structural and agency-related) get mobilized for transformation. This is achieved through analyzing natural resource governance regimes of countries that have been subject to rapid, large-scale political change: water governance in South Africa and Uzbekistan and governance of coastal fisheries in Chile. In South Africa the political and economic change of the end of the apartheid regime resulted in a transformation of the water governance regime while in Uzbekistan after the breakdown of the Soviet Union change both at the economic and political scales and within the water governance regime remained superficial. In Chile the democratization process after the Pinochet era was used to transform the governance of coastal fisheries. The paper concludes with important insight on key capacities needed to navigate transformation towards biosphere stewardship. The study also contributes to a more nuanced view on the relationship between collapse and renewal.

TI  - Structural equation modeling for three aspects of green business practices: a case study of Bangladeshi RMG's industry
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Green business (GB) had often been regarded as a pervasive trend that underlies the operations and performance of businesses. By portrayal of three aspects view of the green business, this paper evaluates green business approaches within the Bangladeshi ready-made garments (RMG) sector and provides a structured framework for the factors affecting the utilization of green business approaches. This study further evaluates how the environmental, societal, and economic impact derived green business practices. The framework is experimentally tested by the partial least square approach to structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) concentrated on survey responses quantifying the green business practices within 40 RMG organizations situated in Dhaka and Chittagong, Bangladesh. The findings demonstrate that there is a positive relationship between environmental, social, and economic aspects. More specifically, the PLS-SEM estimation demonstrates that the interaction between environmental and economic sustainability has a substantial proportion of values towards profiling GB practice. Meanwhile, there is a vast gap for profiling the performances of environmental and economic aspects through social aspects within the RMG sectors of Bangladesh. Also, there is a significant difference between the predicted and factual green business adoption tendencies and views among different industrial enterprises, especially for waste management and water pollution based on the findings of the SEM-PLS model. Throughout the context of the rapid growth of socioeconomic development and new technological advancement, social level performance possess comparably weak influences of GB strategy on the within Bangladeshi RMG sectors. In the meantime, as the stricter law has a vital impact on the firm's strategies for becoming more environmentally friendly practices, it instituted as an essential variable for quantifying social sustainability. Moreover, the study recommends some suggestions emphasizing the part of the identified model in the context of encouraging business organizations to indulge in environment-oriented socio-economy actions and thus change the emphasis of potential GB study directions.

TI  - Implementing the circular economy in the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area: The interplay between market actors mediated by transition brokers
T2  - BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyses the interplay between regime and niche actors in implementing the circular economy through mediation by transition brokers. The study is based on 'action research' carried out in the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area. Innovation science is adopted as theoretical approach. First, the analysis shows that more ambitious initiatives could be taken than by individual market actors. Whether these circular initiatives represent just incremental change-as other studies suggest-cannot be concluded. Rather, it is plausible to conceptualise the transition process as a continuous transformational change. Second, in creating circular initiatives, the interplay between regime and niche actors was evident but varied. Actors could team up more easily where their interests aligned. This conclusion corresponds with recent innovation literature, which emphasises the importance of linkages between processes at niche, regime and landscape levels. Before generalising the results, similar studies in other regional contexts would be valuable. Short informativeIn moving to a circular economy, the willingness of market actors to innovate is crucial. Real-life experiments on the implementation of circular initiatives built by market actors at local level through the mediation of independent intermediaries (here called 'transition brokers') are scarce. This study aims to bridge this knowledge gap by focussing on the interplay between niche and regime actors. Action research on implementing the circular economy programme in the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area (2015-2020) represents an example. Innovation science is adopted as leading theoretical approach. The case shows that more advanced ambitions could be achieved than through individual market actors by themselves. Whether the circular initiatives built represent just incremental change-as suggested in the few other studies-is considered too simplistic. It is concluded to conceptualise the CE transition rather as a continuous, transformational change which takes time. The interplay between niche and regime actors was evident in the case but varied. Niche actors could team up more easily with regime actors where their interests coincided. Niche CE innovations did not necessarily develop in protected environments, as suggested by early MLP studies. They could diffuse more widely if they link up with ongoing processes at regime and landscape level. This conclusion corresponds with the more recent innovation literature.

TI  - Operationalizing Ocean Health: Toward Integrated Research on Ocean Health and Recovery to Achieve Ocean Sustainability
T2  - ONE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Protecting the ocean has become a major goal of international policy as human activities increasingly endanger the integrity of the ocean ecosystem, often summarized as "ocean health.'' By and large, efforts to protect the ocean have failed because, among other things, (1) the underlying socio-ecological pathways have not been properly considered, and (2) the concept of ocean health has been ill defined. Collectively, this prevents an adequate societal response as to how ocean ecosystems and their vital functions for human societies can be protected and restored. We review the confusion surrounding the term "ocean health'' and suggest an operational ocean-health framework in line with the concept of strong sustainability. Given the accelerating degeneration of marine ecosystems, the restoration of regional ocean health will be of increasing importance. Our advocated transdisciplinary and multi-actor framework can help to advance the implementation of more active measures to restore ocean health and safeguard human health and well-being.

TI  - Responding to the COVID-19 Crisis: Transformative Governance in Switzerland
T2  - TIJDSCHRIFT VOOR ECONOMISCHE EN SOCIALE GEOGRAFIE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis, uncertain and experimental forms of governance have emerged. Administrative routines and established management techniques have dissolved amid emergency actions and management by the state of exception. We refer to these emerging governance forms as transformative governance. Discussing examples from Switzerland, we illustrate how policy responses to COVID-19 reflect transformative governance. These examples raise four issues that characterize transformative governance research and practice: (i) the evidence base of policy-making; (ii) the role of the state in transformative governance; (iii) the potential of experimental governance; and (iv) the paradigms driving policy change. Our study demonstrates that these issues imply different opportunities and risks of transformative governance, which we discuss in detail.

TI  - Beyond scientific contribution: Assessment of the societal impact of research and innovation to build a sustainable agri-food sector
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the climate change and increased attention toward environmental management issues, the agri-food sector has been extensively relying on research, development, and innovation (RDi) to transform conventional agricultural production into a sustainable and eco-friendly industry. While the academic contribution of research has been relatively easily identified in the literature, the assessment of its societal impact remains underdeveloped. Accordingly, this study employs mixed-method evaluation approaches, mainly ASIRPA framework and Impact Oriented Monitoring (IOM) model to better understand and measure the multi-dimensional impacts of RDi in the agri-food sector in Spain. The objective of this analysis is to identify the impact of research on the society and the ecosystem. An in-depth case study analysis is conducted to examine the "best practices" program to promote sustainable techniques in the rice cultivation. Empirical findings suggest a standardized index to measure the economic, socio-territorial, health, political, capacity building, and environmental impacts, involving the stakeholder-network evaluation. The study highlights important implications for firm management decisions monitoring research uptake and policy design in the agri-food sector.

TI  - The Function of Transition Brokers in the Regional Governance of Implementing Circular Economy-A Comparative Case Study of Six Dutch Regions
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper addresses the question of which function systemic intermediaries (here called 'transition brokers') can fulfil in the regional governance of implementing a circular economy (CE). Empirical research on this issue is scarce. The conclusion, based on a comparative case study of six Dutch regions, is that transition brokers fulfil the function of system orchestration. They can enhance processes of change, build alliances, help create the necessary preconditions, and develop impactful circular initiatives from a neutral standpoint. In a multi-stakeholder setting, transition brokers fulfil a variety of roles, depending on time period, content, and context. Executing these roles requires a number of specific competencies, varying from being entrepreneurially minded to daring to leave one's comfort zone and being able to get the idea of CE accepted in a variety of businesses and organisations. From interviews held with key transition brokers in the six regions, it transpired that there is a clear division of labour between transition brokers vis-a-vis other key actors, among which the local government is included. These findings allow the design of a new model of regional governance in implementing CE from a system level perspective. It is recommended to perform similar case studies in other countries to generalise the results presented here.

TI  - Citizen science and sustainability transitions
T2  - RESEARCH POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Citizen Science (CS) projects involve members of the general public as active participants in research. While some advocates hope that CS can increase scientific knowledge production ("productivity view"), others emphasize that it may bridge a perceived gap between science and the broader society ("democratization view"). We discuss how an integration of both views can allow Citizen Science to support complex sustainability transitions in areas such as renewable energy, public health, or environmental conservation. We first identify three pathways through which such impacts can occur: (1) Problem identification and agenda setting; (2) Resource mobilization; and (3) Facilitating socio-technical co-evolution. To realize this potential, however, CS needs to address important challenges that emerge especially in the context of sustainability transitions: Increasing the diversity, level, and intensity of participation; addressing the social as well as technical nature of sustainability problems; and reducing tensions between CS and the traditional institution of academic science. Grounded in a review of academic literature and policy reports as well as a broad range of case examples, this article contributes to scholarship on science, innovation, and sustainability transitions. We also offer insights for actors involved in initiating or institutionalizing Citizen Science efforts, including project organizers, funding agencies, and policy makers.

TI  - Collaborative governance in energy regions - Experiences from an Austrian region
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper focuses on the current debate of energy transition at the regional level and aims at filling an existing gap in literature about how to organize transition processes in energy regions. In an effort to do so, the researchers focus on a case study region where a collaborative process for developing an earmarked energy region has been initiated. The purpose of this paper is to identify and understand how collaborative governance needs to be organized in order to foster energy transition in the energy region under study. The research is designed as sequential case study analysis based on different data collection steps including desk and field research as well as participatory research and observation. The research team worked with regional stakeholders and in a first step a moderated stakeholder identification process informed the subsequent stakeholder and governance analysis. Our results show that a moderated stakeholder identification process helps to integrate the relevant stakeholders in a strong alliance building process which helps to avoid information asymmetries and to detect path-dependent structures and systemic lock-ins. External support also helps identifying relevant actors outside the group of 'usual suspects'. One lesson learned is to establish supportive institutional structures allowing less committed stakeholders to change their mindset and to create mutual interest. The paper provides theoretical and empirical insights for both academics and practitioners. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Practice-based model for implementing circular economy: The case of the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper questions how the implementation of the circular economy actually takes place and evolves over time, using the geographical example of the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area. This particular practiceoriented, regional focus is underexposed in the literature. Relying upon transition management literature, the analysis shows through five years' action-research that a pipeline of tailor-made circular initiatives, all at varying speeds, was created and when successful, scaled up. This is visualised in a 'practicebased model for implementing circular economy', which specifies the four-phase model by Rotmans et al. (2001). By developing a scheme which represents the activities needed in each phase of the implementation process, Loorbach's transition management cycle (2010) could be refined. Contrary to what Loorbach suggests, these activities largely follow not only a sequential order, but are also cyclic. Studies on similar initiatives in other regional contexts will allow for generalisation of the results gained in the study presented here. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The COVID-19 crisis as an opportunity for escaping the unsustainable global tourism path
T2  - TOURISM GEOGRAPHIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has halted mobility globally on an unprecedented scale, causing the neoliberal market mechanisms of global tourism to be severely disrupted. In turn, this situation is leading to the decline of certain mainstream business formats and, simultaneously, the emergence of others. Based on a review of recent crisis recovery processes, the tourism sector is likely to rebound from this sudden market shock, primarily because of various forms of government interventions. Nevertheless, although policymakers seek to strengthen the resilience of post-pandemic tourism, their subsidies and other initiatives serve to maintain a fundamentally flawed market logic. The crisis has, therefore, brought us to a fork in the road - giving us the perfect opportunity to select a new direction and move forward by adopting a more sustainable path. Specifically, COVID-19 offers public, private, and academic actors a unique opportunity to design and consolidate the transition towards a greener and more balanced tourism. Tourism scholars, for example, can take a leading role in this by redesigning their curriculum to prepare future industry leaders for a more responsible travel and tourism experience.

TI  - Capturing Waste or Capturing Innovation? Comparing Self-Organising Potentials of Surplus Food Redistribution Initiatives to Prevent Food Waste
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The context for this article is the rapid international growth of (surplus) food redistribution initiatives. These are frequently reliant on networks of volunteer labour, often coordinated by digital means. Movements with these characteristics are increasingly viewed by researchers, policymakers and practitioners as cases of self-organisation. The article explores the nature and extent of self-organisation in food redistribution initiatives. Two contrasting UK initiatives were studied using ethnographic methods during a period of rapid expansion. The concept of self-organisation was operationalised using three dimensions-autonomy, expansion and governance. One initiative established food banks in close cooperation with corporate food actors. Its franchise charity model involved standardised safety protocols and significant centralised control. The other initiative deliberately pursued autonomy, rapid recruitment and de-centralised governance; nevertheless, collaboration with industry actors and a degree of centralised control became a (contested) part of the approach. We highlight the interplay of organisational agency and institutional structures affecting the self-organisation of surplus food redistribution, including ways in which movement dynamism can involve capture by dominant interests but also the seeds of transformative practices that challenge root causes of food waste, particularly food's commodification. Our analysis provides a way to compare the potentials of food charity vs mutual aid in effecting systemic change.

TI  - Bridging Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty (DMDU) and Transition Management (TM) to improve strategic planning for sustainable development
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable development is a long-term endeavour involving deep uncertainty and requiring transformative change at multiple scales. To navigate such a grand challenge, new approaches have been developed in various academic fields, such as Policy Analysis and Sustainability Transitions. Two prominent approaches to strategic planning within these two fields are Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty (DMDU) and Transition Management (TM). While DMDU provides analytical concepts and tools to prepare for change (one that happens anyway, whether or not we desire it), TM offers a governance approach to condition change (one that we desire). We argue that the sustainable development agenda could benefit from an explicit cross-fertilisation across the two approaches. We will highlight the commonalities and differences between the two approaches and reflect on potential cross-connections. We argue that DMDU can benefit from the participatory process of TM, and its interventionist approach, which helps to mobilise actors and build networks for sustainability transformations. DMDU can also learn from some of the governance instruments offered by TM, such as visioning, experimentation, and social learning to better prepare for change that can only be dealt with through transformative actions. TM, on the other hand, can be enriched by analytical concepts and tools developed by and widely used in DMDU, such as tipping points and signposts, exploratory scenarios, and Exploratory Modelling, to operationalise transition pathways into actionable policy decisions. An illustrative example is used to demonstrate what a cross-connection between the two approaches might look like.

TI  - Ecosocial innovations enabling social work to promote new forms of sustainable economy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WELFARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Social work research and practice that address environmental sustainability have already become prominent. However, a change in unsustainable economic structures is also urgently needed. This study explored emerging opportunities in theory and practice for a sustainable economy that are relevant to the aims of social work. As practical examples, our study concerns 'ecosocial innovations', i.e., social innovations that combine ecological and social goals. We analysed how these grassroots innovations in the field of social work reflect crucial shared conceptions of alternative economies. The qualitative data set comprised of 50 ecosocial innovations and six case studies in five European countries. The findings show a rich diversity of ecosocial innovations and describe how they reframe economic purposes, value economic diversity and democratise the economy. We suggest that social work might consider these practices as opportunities for collaboration, especially regarding work with people on the margins of the labour market.

TI  - Wandering identities in energy transition discourses: Political leaders' use of the "we" pronoun in Ontario, 2009-2019
T2  - CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper explores the use of universalizing language as a discursive strategy to promote shifts in energy policy. Building on scholarship that seeks to understand the political nature of energy transitions, including resistance to transitions, the role of the state, and implications for justice, we examine three phases of energy transition in Ontario in the period 2009-2019, focusing on the ways that three successive ruling coalitions used the first plural pronoun "we" to promote contrasting energy policy orientations. Our analysis of policy documents and government news releases confirms that all three coalitions used the "we" form as a strategic device to define priorities, prescribe courses of action, and broadcast achievements. However, they also used the ambiguity of the "we" form to obscure alternative perspectives, claim credit for rivals' accomplishments, and gloss over harmful and differentiated impacts of policy choices. The paper concludes by reflecting on broader questions about power and justice relevant to energy transition scholars.

TI  - How to change the sources of meaning of resistance identities in historically coal-reliant mining communities
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper explores the sociocultural identity debate surrounding coal mining and coal combustion infrastructures in Aragonese coalfields (Spain) to better understand local and individual resistance to energy transition. Adopting the Touraine-Castells sociological perspective and using an interpretive approach and a qualitative research design with in-depth interviews, this article focuses on cultural attributes that give meaning to resistance and project identities under construction. It also explores how resistance identities are linked to climate and energy policies and proposes an analytical framework to understand and to design decarbonisation pathways from resistance identities to project identities. The following conclusions are drawn from this study: a) the sources of meaning supporting current resistance identities are similar to juxtaposed, legitimising coal-phase identities (occupational, class-belonging and community identities), are reactive and founded on coal dependence, solidarity and justice; and b) resistance can only be overcome by a sustainable territorial project with a social base, which is why the adaptive dilemmas of historically coal-reliant mining communities (HCRCs) must be resolved. This research paper demonstrates the need for innovative governance to promote a transformative transition that addresses the sociocultural identities of HCRCs in the design of ecological transition contracts.

TI  - The art of co-creation: An intervention in the philosophy of ecological economics
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Today, the status of science in society is increasingly contested. One reason is immanent to science: Facing hypercomplex systems and 'wicked problems', science cannot provide an unequivocal and binding basis for action and policy design. This problem is especially pronounced in systemic contexts in which epistemic subjects and objects are entangled in a co-evolutionary relationship, as in the economy, which is the core driver of climate change. I argue that in these contexts, 'art' becomes an epistemic mode on equal status with 'science' conventionally understood: Art is the epistemic mode of co-creation. This argument builds on the philosophy of post-Kantian German idealism and its intellectual metamorphoses, such as in American pragmatism. I discuss the essentials of this view, present examples from the field of Ecological economics and draw practical conclusions for method.

TI  - Stakeholders and social influence in a shadow network: implications for transitions toward urban water sustainability in the Colorado River basin
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Shadow networks can play an important role in facilitating transitions toward more sustainable and resilient social-ecological systems. Yet, few studies have explored the microdynamics of shadow networks to understand what makes them more or less effective in sustainability transitions. This article examines stakeholder roles and social influence in support of radical innovations over time in a shadow network focused on urban water sustainability in the Colorado River basin. Using qualitative analysis of meeting transcripts and social network analysis, we analyzed the roles of stakeholders from market, government, and scientific sectors in advocating for and influencing other shadow-network members to consider incremental and radical innovations over a 5-year period. The results show that, in our case, stakeholders from the market sector suggested most of the radical innovations. Government-aligned stakeholders mostly supported others' suggestions and facilitated support for niche innovations to become more widespread. Science stakeholders were supportive of others' proposals but were never the source of new ideas for radical innovations; they focused more on interrogating the evidence for and efficacy of others' proposals. These results illustrate how shadow networks can nurture support for radical innovations over time, even when most network members are aligned with the current regime. This research yields new insights about shadow networks in sustainability transitions, and points to the need for more focused analysis of stakeholder roles and social influences within shadow networks to help understand how radical innovations gain support and become better institutionalized.

TI  - Edible cities - An innovative nature-based solution for urban sustainability transformation? An explorative study of urban food production in German cities
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities are confronted with different societal challenges calling for urban sustainability transformation (UST). Nature-based solutions (NbS) can provide actions for such challenges and strive for maximizing environmental, social and economic benefits. Edible cities, which encompass different forms of urban food production (UFP) in the city, can be seen as multifunctional NbS. However, the concept of edible cities has just recently arrived in research and its understanding as potential NbS supporting UST is still fragmented. Therefore, the study created an analytical framework, which aims at identifying and prioritizing 1) challenges that edible cities can contribute in the context of UST and 2) strategies for implementing and mainstreaming the edible city in the context of urban sustainability acceleration. The study is of explorative character and encompasses interviews with key actors from three German case studies: Andernach - a German frontrunner in implementing the edible city, Haar - follower I, which implemented the concept after learning from Andernach and Munich - follower II, where the concept of edible cities was not yet implemented but a range of bottom-up activities exist to promote the topic. Results show that edible cities can be seen as NbS that can support UST in terms of social-spatial and socioecological transformation, in particular promoting social cohesion and human-nature and food connection. In terms of implementing and mainstreaming, the results suggest that the edible city can be taken up by different city departments due to its multifunctionality. Furthermore, a mix of motivated bottom-up initiatives and topdown authorities paired with courage and room for experimentation on the edible city is crucial for its embedding. Apart from that, network creation with different UFP initiatives as well as with other cities is an important factor for mainstreaming edible cities. Future research shall WA the transferability of the analytical framework to other NbS analyzing their potential to contribute to UST.

TI  - Research pathways to foster transformation: linking sustainability science and social-ecological systems research
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although sustainability science and social-ecological systems research pursue very similar goals, i.e., generate problem- and solution-oriented knowledge to foster sustainability transformation, they partly apply different research approaches and use different key concepts. Our aim is to identify archetypes of sustainability transformation research derived for sustainability science and social-ecological systems research that make knowledge from the two research pathways more accessible to each other in order to foster transformation. To reach this goal, we applied a mixed method approach toward an archetype analysis, based on semantic networks and clusters. Our findings point out that the fields of sustainability science and social-ecological systems research are rather coherent and not so distinct as may be expected, especially in terms of normative goals and addressed topics. Our analysis inductively reveals four archetypes of sustainability transformation research, with thematic structures clustered around (1) environmental change and ecosystem services; (2) resilience and vulnerability; (3) knowledge production for sustainability; and (4) governance for sustainability. We describe how these archetypes interact and facilitate dialogue between the fields. When considering the two transformation research pathways from the perspective of the research mode of transdisciplinary research, their discourses appear more disconnected. To fill this gap, we uncover key concepts that can strengthen the connection of the two fields to inform and foster sustainability transformations. These concepts involve engaging with nonacademic actors and seeking impact in policy.

TI  - Indigenous and local knowledge in sustainability transformations research: a literature review
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Review
AB  - Scholars, politicians, practitioners, and civil society increasingly call for sustainability transformations to cope with urgent social and environmental challenges. In sustainability transformations research, understandings of transformations are often dominated by Western scientific knowledge. Through a systematic literature review, we investigated how indigenous and local knowledge (ILK) is represented in peer-reviewed empirical scientific papers that apply ILK in contexts of transformation, transition, and change. Our results show, first, that all papers applied ILK to confirm and complement scientific knowledge in contexts of environmental, climate, social-ecological, and species change. Only four papers (5%) applied ILK to conduct research on transformations. Second, we identified four research clusters that apply ILK in contexts of transformation, transition, or change in (1) Arctic, (2) terrestrial, (3) coastal, and (4) grass and rangelands environments. These clusters are located along two axes: tropic to Arctic and marine to terrestrial. Finally, our results indicate that indigenous and local understandings of transformations are currently neglected in the scholarly transformations discourse. The reviewed papers do not focus on how indigenous peoples and local communities understand transformations, instead they focus on what changes indigenous peoples and local communities observe and describe, resulting from their daily experiences and activities. We argue that because of its in-depth local, place-based character, ILK can substantially contribute to a more plural understanding of transformations and the assessment of transformative change. We conclude that future research needs to investigate how to gain a more plural understanding of transformations that leads potentially to more inclusive actions toward more just, equitable, and sustainable futures on a local and global level.

TI  - Dealing with the game-changing technologies of Agriculture 4.0: How do we manage diversity and responsibility in food system transition pathways?
T2  - GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY-AGRICULTURE POLICY ECONOMICS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Agriculture 4.0 is comprised of different already operational or developing technologies such as robotics, nanotechnology, synthetic protein, cellular agriculture, gene editing technology, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and machine learning, which may have pervasive effects on future agriculture and food systems and major transformative potential. These technologies underpin concepts such as vertical farming and food systems, digital agriculture, bioeconomy, circular agriculture, and aquaponics. In this perspective paper, we argue that more attention is needed for the inclusion and exclusion effects of Agriculture 4.0 technologies, and for reflection on how they relate to diverse transition pathways towards sustainable agricultural and food systems driven by mission-oriented innovation systems. This would require processes of responsible innovation, anticipating the potential impacts of Agriculture 4.0 through inclusive processes, and reflecting on and being responsive to emerging effects and where needed adjusting the direction and course of transition pathways.

TI  - Transition heuristic frameworks in research on agro-food sustainability transitions
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - The agro-food system needs a genuine sustainability transition to achieve sustainable food and nutrition security in the face of climate change, population growth, ecosystem degradation and increasing resource scarcity. Agro-food sustainability transitions refer to transformation processes needed to move towards sustainable agriculture and food systems. There is a broad range of theoretical and conceptual frameworks that have been used to understand and promote transition towards sustainability. These include the multi-level perspective (MLP) on socio-technical transitions, transition management (TM), strategic niche management (SNM), technological innovation system (TIS) and social practice approach (SPA). The paper analyses the use of these heuristic frameworks in research on agro-food sustainability transitions. A search carried out in March 2018 on Scopus yielded 791 documents, and 127 research articles underwent a systematic review. Results show that more than three-fifths of research papers dealing with sustainability transitions in agriculture, food processing, distribution and consumption use at least one of the five heuristic frameworks (MLP, TM, SNM, TIS and SPA). The MLP is the most prominent framework in research on agro-food sustainability transitions, followed by TM, SPA, SNM and then TIS. Nevertheless, MLP is increasingly complemented with frameworks that focus on human-related and social factors (SPA), management and governance (TM, SNM) or agency and interactions between actors (TIS) in sustainability transitions processes. Therefore, the paper makes the case for more integration of transition frameworks in order to better nurture and foster transitions towards sustainable agro-food systems.

TI  - Seeds of good anthropocenes: developing sustainability scenarios for Northern Europe
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Scenario development helps people think about a broad variety of possible futures; however, the global environmental change community has thus far developed few positive scenarios for the future of the planet and humanity. Those that have been developed tend to focus on the role of a few common, large-scale external drivers, such as technology or environmental policy, even though pathways of positive change are often driven by surprising or bottom-up initiatives that most scenarios assume are unchanging. We describe an approach, pioneered in Southern Africa and tested here in a new context in Northern Europe, to developing scenarios using existing bottom-up transformative initiatives to examine plausible transitions towards positive, sustainable futures. By starting from existing, but marginal initiatives, as well as current trends, we were able to identify system characteristics that may play a key role in sustainability transitions (e.g., gender issues, inequity, governance, behavioral change) that are currently under-explored in global environmental scenarios. We suggest that this approach could be applied in other places to experiment further with the methodology and its potential applications, and to explore what transitions to desirables futures might be like in different places.

TI  - The political imaginaries of blockchain projects: discerning the expressions of an emerging ecosystem
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a wealth of information, hype around, and research into blockchain's 'disruptive' and 'transformative' potential concerning every industry. However, there is an absence of scholarly attention given to identifying and analyzing the political premises and consequences of blockchain projects. Through digital ethnography and participatory action research, this article shows how blockchain experiments personify 'prefigurative politics' by design: they embody the politics and power structures which they want to enable in society. By showing how these prefigurative embodiments are informed and determined by the underlying political imaginaries, the article proposes a basic typology of blockchain projects. Furthermore, it outlines a frame to question, cluster, and analyze the expressions of political imaginaries intrinsic to the design and operationalization of blockchain projects on three analytic levels: users, intermediaries, and institutions.

AB  - While practice theories and diverse economy approaches are widely employed by human geographers, the two literatures have developed in parallel, rather than in dialogue. This article argues that this has constrained understandings of postcapitalist social change and traces an emerging theoretical conversation between these traditions. It outlines the potential of scholarly engagement with what we term 'diverse practices', especially when discussing the scalar possibilities and constraints of community activism. By grounding diverse economic scholarship in practice-theoretical conceptions of power, politics, and scale, the article proposes a materialisation of postcapitalist possibility and explores the barriers and facilitators of transformative geographies.

AB  - Impact assessment (IA) formally emerged fifty years ago, it evolved, matured but the predominant philosophy did not change much, especially in light of the speed of change the world experiences and the magnitude and persistency of current environmental and social problems. Inspired in the sustainable transitions theory, and the adaptive theory, I reflect in this letter on the need to shift the philosophy underlying current IA rules and practice, to renovate or even reinvent the instrument to become more collaborative, constructive and systemic, driven by learning and co-creation of knowledge. This might mean a paradigm shift, towards a more engaging and persuasive IA, a leverage to enable changing practices in an increasingly complex world, and a positive instrument to help transitions for sustainability and the achievement of sustainable development goals.

TI  - Outcome-based management for sustainability
T2  - IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND PROJECT APPRAISAL
M3  - Article
AB  - EIA/SEA is effects-based management involving assessing adverse effects of proposed programs or projects and developing measures to avoid or mitigate adverse effects. Government has a regulatory role through assessment processes and monitoring compliance with conditions. However, EIA/SEA has not prevented environmental bottom-lines from being exceeded and has led to further environmental degradation. Sustainable development requires a proactive role by government for programs and projects to achieve targeted outcomes. Rather than relying on proponent-led projects and compliance with conditions, outcome-based management is needed. This involves sustainability strategies to meet multiple community outcomes, for programs and projects to be aligned with those strategies, and, auditing of implementation against achievement of outcomes. A systems approach is described for developing sustainability strategies through failure pathway analysis and management interventions to address critical variables where resilience thresholds are threatened. Implementation requires projects to be aligned with the strategies, management systems demonstrating how compatibility can be achieved, and, management plans for specifying measures to achieve the sustainability targets with independent auditing of plan adoption and outcome achievement.

T2  - POLICY STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Hajer and Wagenaar originally proposed Deliberative Policy Analysis (DPA) as an approach suited to transforming a policy world characterized by complexity, pluralism and unpredictability. Because its transformative ambitions have long remained unfulfilled, DPA has begun embracing a variety of Action Research (AR) approaches committed to generating policy change in a world beset by multiple sustainability crises. However, a systematic assessment of how AR can make DPA more transformative has been absent thus far. We argue that AR can strengthen the transformative ambitions of DPA in three ways. First, it helps clarify the purposes of DPA based on a critical and relational worldview emanating from their shared pragmatist foundations. Second, it unveils the structural challenges of becoming more transformative in the shadow of the hegemonic institutional organization of academic and policy systems. Finally, it provides a heuristic framework for engaging in the critical-relational dynamics of generating policy change and sustainability transitions. We conclude with a number of recommendations, based on AR principles, practices and experiences, that deliberative policy analysts can adopt to help their initiatives become more transformative.

TI  - Housing and household practices: Practice-based sustainability interventions for low-energy houses in Lahore, Pakistan
T2  - ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focuses on low-energy interventions in the design and use of houses from a socio-technical perspective. It explores the links between housing (design) and household (use) practices for sustainability transitions in middle-class housing in Lahore, Pakistan. Using two case-study houses as examples of variation in design, in addition to semi-structured interviews with housing practitioners, the paper investigates the transitions needed in housing practices that, through interventions in house design, can lead to less energy-intensive household practice-arrangements. It uses a practice-based intervention framework to explore how housing and household practices can be recrafted, substituted and changes made to how they interlock for improved sustainability. "Good" housing practices such as integration of more flexible, performance-based byelaws to meet minimum standards, better knowledge and skills of practitioners, good communication between stakeholders and the availability of low-carbon material supply chains can lead to "good" household practices, such as changed meanings of comfort, more outdoor-based activities and collective practice-arrangements. The paper thus highlights inadequacies of existing economically-driven, techno-determinist efficiency models to meet required levels of housing energy demand. The practice approach makes the connections between "good" and "bad" housing and household practices visible and demonstrates their significance in identifying key areas of sustainability interventions.

TI  - Why Sustainable Development Requires Societal Innovation and Cannot Be Achieved without This
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper discusses the need for societal innovation as a systemic form of innovation for sustainable development. Sustainable development requires collective action from stakeholders in the form of system building activities, which in its turn requires societal innovation. Through societal innovation, based on multiple value creation, external costs are being prevented or reduced because of innovation-oriented explorations within a wider frame (a societal improvement perspective), ascertained by the actors. This requires design thinking and proper distribution of the costs and benefits, accepted by the participants. With this paper, we hope to advance the research agenda on societal innovation based on multi-actor improvement processes and associated intentional logics, as topics that are weakly theorized in the business literature on sustainable development and the sustainability transition literature. We are critical of triple helix models and models emphasizing shared value creation because these underestimate the importance of disinterest and conflicts of interests to be managed via multiple value creation on the basis of recursive multi-actor intentionality.

TI  - Learnings from Local Collaborative Transformations: Setting a Basis for a Sustainability Framework
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The complexity of the sustainability challenge demands for collaboration between different actors, be they governments, businesses, or grassroots movements, at all levels. Nevertheless, and according to previous research, many tensions and obstacles to partnership still exist and results are far from meaningful. By investigating potential synergies, our purpose is to define a sustainability framework to promote better collaboration between community-based initiatives and local governments, in the context of transformation. Specifically, the research aim presented in this paper is to harvest learnings from existing collaborative experiments at the municipal level. As a starting point and using exploratory literature review concerning areas like policy (e.g., public administration) or business and management research, we propose a 'Compass for Collaborative Transformation'. This heuristic device can support the study of these sustainability experiments. We also introduce a method to map the governance imprint of these collaborations and to provide a 'proxy' of transformative efforts. We then present and discuss results from 71 surveyed cases happening in 16 countries in America and Europe, comparing distinctive frameworks involved. Finally, we consider the preconditions of a framework to improve these local collaborations-namely the capacity to support joint navigation through transformative efforts, facing high levels of uncertainty and complexity-and present ongoing efforts to codesign a new sustainability framework.

TI  - Multi-scale analysis of the spatial structure of China's major function zoning
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial structures of China's Major Function Zoning are important constraining indicators in all types of spatial planning and key parameters for accurately downscaling major functions. Taking the proportion of urbanization zones, agricultural development zones and ecological security zones as the basic parameter, this paper explores the spatial structures of major function zoning at different scales using spatial statistics, spatial modeling and landscape metrics methods. The results show: First, major function zones have spatial gradient structures, which are prominently represented by latitudinal and longitudinal gradients, a coastal distance gradient, and an eastern-central-western gradient. Second, the pole-axis system structure and core-periphery structure exist at provincial scales. The general principle of the pole-axis structure is that as one moves along the distance axis, the proportion of urbanization zones decreases and the proportion of ecological security zones increases. This also means that the proportion of different function zones has a ring-shaped spatial differentiation principle with distance from the core. Third, there is a spatial mosaic structure at the city and county scale. This spatial mosaic structure has features of both spatial heterogeneity, such as agglomeration and dispersion, as well as of mutual, adjacent topological correlation and spatial proximity. The results of this study contribute to scientific knowledge on major function zones and the principles of spatial organization, and it acts as an important reference for China's integrated geographical zoning.

TI  - Drivers and projections of vegetation loss in the Pantanal and surrounding ecosystems
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Modeling scenarios can help identify drivers of and potential changes in land use, particularly in rapidly changing landscapes such as the tropics. One of the places where most of the recent anthropogenic land use changes have been occurring is the (n)arc of deforestation" of the Amazon, where several scenarios have been constructed. Such modeling scenarios, however, have been implemented less frequently in wetland areas, but these are also undergoing rapid change. An example is the Pantanal, one of the largest wetlands on the planet located in the Upper Paraguay River Basin (UPRB). The UPRB is formed by the lowland (Pantanal) and the plateau (Cerrado and Amazon where the spring-fed rivers are). We used a spatially explicit model to identify drivers of vegetation loss in the Pantanal and surrounding area (UPRB) and estimated potential vegetation loss for the next 30 years. The model is probabilistic and considers that vegetation loss is contagious, so that the local rate of deforestation increases over time if adjacent sites are deforested, also taking into account the drivers identified in those locations. Our study is the first to simulate vegetation loss at property-scale, over 20,000 properties, for the entire UPRB in Brazil, taking into account the relationship between the plateau, where headwaters are located, and the lowland, where flooded-areas are concentrated. The drivers of vegetation loss identified for the lowland (distance to roads and rivers and elevation) differed from those for the plateau (distance to cities), demonstrating the relevance of analyzing areas separately. The cumulative rate of native vegetation loss projected for 2050 was 3% for the lowland and 10% for the plateau, representing losses of 6045 km(2) and of native vegetation area decreasing from 87% to 83% and 7960 km(2) from 39% to 35% respectively by 2050, if changes continue at the same pace and if the environmental legislation is followed. The projected vegetation loss in the UPRB forms a geographical arc, very similar to that observed in the Amazon, from the plateau into the lowland. The arc is directly related to areas with no or low flooding frequency because they are suitable for agriculture. The identification of this arc of vegetation loss calls for urgent conservation policies for this wetland and new perspectives for management.

TI  - Expertise in research integration and implementation for tackling complex problems: when is it needed, where can it be found and how can it be strengthened?
T2  - PALGRAVE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Expertise in research integration and implementation is an essential but often overlooked component of tackling complex societal and environmental problems. We focus on expertise relevant to any complex problem, especially contributory expertise, divided into 'knowing-that' and 'knowing-how.' We also deal with interactional expertise and the fact that much expertise is tacit. We explore three questions. First, in examining 'when is expertise in research integration and implementation required?,' we review tasks essential (a) to developing more comprehensive understandings of complex problems, plus possible ways to address them, and (b) for supporting implementation of those understandings into government policy, community practice, business and social innovation, or other initiatives. Second, in considering 'where can expertise in research integration and implementation currently be found?,' we describe three realms: (a) specific approaches, including interdisciplinarity, transdisciplinarity, systems thinking and sustainability science; (b) case-based experience that is independent of these specific approaches; and (c) research examining elements of integration and implementation, specifically considering unknowns and fostering innovation. We highlight examples of expertise in each realm and demonstrate how fragmentation currently precludes clear identification of research integration and implementation expertise. Third, in exploring 'what is required to strengthen expertise in research integration and implementation?,' we propose building a knowledge bank. We delve into three key challenges: compiling existing expertise, indexing and organising the expertise to make it widely accessible, and understanding and overcoming the core reasons for the existing fragmentation. A growing knowledge bank of expertise in research integration and implementation on the one hand, and accumulating success in addressing complex societal and environmental problems on the other, will form a virtuous cycle so that each strengthens the other. Building a coalition of researchers and institutions will ensure this expertise and its application are valued and sustained.

TI  - How a Strategic Scoping Canvas Can Facilitate Collaboration between Partners in Sustainability Transitions
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The loosely applied concepts of transformations and transitions often result in unarticulated different visions and expectations among stakeholders regarding the orientation and ambition of a particular initiative related to system transitions/transformations. In this paper, a strategic scoping canvas and an associated facilitation process are presented as a way of enhancing shared understanding among stakeholders. Illustrations are provided of initial application in three cases related to food system transitions in Peru, Ethiopia, and Bangladesh, exploring the connectivity with approaches commonly used in the context of system transformations, including the Multi-Level Perspective on sustainability transitions, the Leverage Points approach, Capability Approach, and the theory of Large System Change. We conclude that the canvas and associated facilitation approach has proved useful in different contexts, offering opportunities for complementing existing methodologies, and potentially enhancing their efficacy in facilitated multi-stakeholder processes.

M3  - Article
AB  - The use of formal planning approaches fell into disrepute in the 1980s and few guidelines exist in economics textbooks on how to plan for the systemic and profound transformations that societies need to achieve. This article questions the utility, form and method of collective planning for sustainable development. While sustainable development planning is close to past planning experiences in some respects, it is unprecedented in others. I elaborate on one particular approach to planning, which focuses on fostering collective deliberations and bargaining about alternative sustainable development strategies. Two applications confront this theoretical and methodological reflexion to concrete twenty-first century challenges: The design of national strategies to address climate change and carbon pricing policies.

TI  - Coordinating sustainability, globalization and urban intelligence with the Habitat III and 2030-SDG agendas: the challenge of sustainable urban development in cities
T2  - CUADERNOS DE ADMINISTRACION-UNIVERSIDAD DEL VALLE
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, there are difficulties in coordinating the three determinants of urban development in cities: Globalization, Urban Intelligence, and Sustainability. This makes it difficult to implement the agendas of the Sustainable Development Goals and Habitat III. This article features an introduction, discussion on the tensions among the determinants of Sustainable Urban Development (SUD). The idea of a sustainable city, which is defended in this research, is proposed thereafter, which seeks to establish the degree of consistency between these three factors. The methodology is described next on: 83 cities were sampled and the simple and multiple correspondence analysis techniques were applied. Then, we move on to the results, which found that while the three phenomena are congruent, it is not the same in every city. It was also evidenced that the greater the urban intelligence of a city, the more sustainable it will be; and the less sustainable it will be if it is oriented only towards globalization. Finally, it is concluded that if a city wants to be sustainable, it must make efforts to coordinate a joint agenda with all three conditioning factors to balance them out and neglect none.

TI  - Engaging in disruption: A review of emerging microgrids in Victoria, Australia
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Growing global consensus around the pressing need for decarbonisation to avert uncertain climate futures has accelerated the transition away from fossil fuels, towards widespread experimentation with distributed energy systems and practices. An investigation of four different microgrid-related experiments in Victoria, Australia revealed a number of commonalities and differences in relation to the drivers and challenges that supported and constrained these innovative projects. Despite differences in the types of microgrid projects examined, the case studies presented similar internal challenges, particularly in relation to organisational and individual risk aversion. External challenges arising from the broader regime were also present, particularly in relation to securing regulatory approvals, limitations in workforce capacity, and lack of industry acceptance. The empirical data suggests that the majority of challenges identified speak to the socio-institutional context rather than technological feasibility. Drawing on niche management framings, seven critical strategies for policy development aimed at shielding, nurturing and empowering future microgrid projects to move beyond experimentation and achieve more widespread decarbonisation are presented.

AB  - To support a sustainable mobility transition and zero-carbon economy globally, important efforts are currently being made towards the use of sustainable transport, such as electric vehicles. In this context, the role of lithium is crucial for the manufacturing of electric vehicles powered by lithium-ion batteries. However, more than half of the global lithium reserves are located in the three Latin American countries comprising the so-called Lithium Triangle - namely, Argentina, Bolivia and Chile. Each of these countries has a different national lithium regime and national policy to support the lithium industry in the processing and export of this natural resource. This paper analyses the potential of socio-technical transition theory for building a sustainable global lithium industry, with emphasis on Argentina, Bolivia and Chile. We adopt a multilevel perspective to explore the major mining policies and national lithium arrangements, industry challenges and future scenarios among major industry and public actors in these countries.

TI  - Sustainability Science: Toward a Synthesis
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES, VOL 45
M3  - Review
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - This review synthesizes diverse approaches that researchers have brought to bear on the challenge of sustainable development. We construct an integrated framework highlighting the union set of elements and relationships that those approaches have shown to be useful in explaining nature-society interactions in multiple contexts. Compelling evidence has accumulated that those interactions should be viewed as a globally interconnected, complex adaptive system in which heterogeneity, nonlinearity, and innovation play formative roles. The long-term evolution of that system cannot be predicted but can be understood and partially guided through dynamic interventions. Research has identified six capacities necessary to support such interventions in guiding development pathways toward sustainability. These are capacities to (a) measure sustainable development, (b) promote equity, (c) adapt to shocks and surprises, (d) transform the system into more sustainable development pathways, (e) link knowledge with action, and (f) devise governance arrangements that allow people to work together in exercising the other capacities.

TI  - Lost in translation: How legacy limits the OECD in promoting new policy mixes for sustainability transitions
T2  - RESEARCH POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The OECD has a strong legacy in shaping innovation policy mixes. The purpose of this paper is therefore to provide a better understanding of how the OECD is currently shaping new policy mixes for sustainability transitions. It provides a detailed account of the uptake of system innovation thinking, a key concept in transition studies, at the OECD. It takes an ethnographic approach combining desk research with participant observation, allowing to study 'discourse in the making'. The paper traces the different translation and inscription strategies pursued. It finds that despite purposeful efforts, system innovation has not been institutionalised in the core activities of the organisation, thus can be considered 'lost in translation'. It concludes that legacy effects created a number of sticking points that can be categorised under three main categories: (1) institutional, arising from previous ways of working; (2) cognitive, arising from ways of framing and knowing and (3) political, arising from pre-existing power relations. Suggestions are made for both innovation policy academics and practitioners interested in promoting a transformative innovation agenda.

TI  - More than peanuts: Transformation towards a circular economy through a small-wins governance framework
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Governments across the world aim to accelerate the transition to a circular economy. A pressing question is to what extent and how they can influence transformative change, especially since a circular economy also inherently conflicts with norms underlying existing policies and regulations. Existing circular economy governance literature provide lists of barriers and develop targeted interventions without analyzing underlying mechanisms. This paper bridges this gap by presenting a coherent conceptual framework of continuous transformative change through accumulating small wins. Examples from Dutch Circular Economy Transition Program illustrate the arguments. Small wins are characterized by concrete results in terms of in-depth changes of moderate importance. In the long run, these small wins can amplify and accumulate into transformative change through non-linear mechanisms such as energizing, learning by doing, the logic of attraction, the bandwagon effect, coupling, and robustness. The related governance framework consists of three groups of interventions: 1) setting a provocative ambition; 2) identifying and appreciating small wins; 3) activating mechanisms through which smalls wins can accumulate in transformative change. The small-wins perspective embraces ambiguity, cherishes emerging change, replaces linear governance models by circular systems thinking, and provides insights about how small wins accumulate. First observations indicate that, although the small-wins perspective intuitively makes sense to governance actors, it clashes with the rather unrealistic expectations about governing transitions in rapid, radical, and top-down/linear ways. Hence, governing the acceleration of a linear to a circular economy, requires the transformation of the linearly organized governance system itself. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Transforming Research and Innovation for Sustainable Food Systems-A Coupled-Systems Perspective
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Current research and innovation (R&I) systems are not equipped to fully serve as catalysts for the urgently needed transformation of food systems. Though research on food systems transformation (first order: 'what?') and transformative research (second order: 'how to') are rapidly gaining traction in academic and policy environments, current efforts fail to explicitly recognize the systemic nature of the challenges associated with performing transformative second-order research. To recognize these manifold and interlinked challenges embedded in R&I systems, there is a need for a coupled-systems perspective. Transformations are needed in food systems as well as R&I systems ('how to do the "how to"'). We set out to conceptualize an approach that aims to trigger double transformations by nurturing innovations at the boundaries of R&I systems and food systems that act upon systemic leverage points, so that their multisystem interactions can better support food system transformations. We exemplify this coupled-systems approach by introducing the FIT4FOOD2030 project with its 25 living labs as a promising multilevel boundary innovation at the cross-section of R&I and food systems. We illustrate how this approach paves the way for double systems transformations, and therefore for an R&I system that is fit for future-proofing food systems.

TI  - Soil as a Basis to Create Enabling Conditions for Transitions Towards Sustainable Land Management as a Key to Achieve the SDGs by 2030
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can be grouped into three domains, the environmental domain, the social domain and the economic domain. These different layers influence each other; hence sustainable progress in the economic layer cannot be achieved without good progress in the two other layers. To achieve the SDGs, transitions in the current system are needed and actions should be taken that support transitions and contribute to short term needs and long term (global) goals. Therefore, it is necessary to have knowledge of transitions and understand the different phases of transition. In this paper we discuss the key role of the soil-water system in these transitions and the achievement of the SDGs by 2030. The increasing pressure on land calls for multi-use of land and for the restoration of degraded land. Healthy soils and healthy land are the basic conditions for the successful implementation and realization of the SDGs. To enable a sustainable management of the soil and water system a transition approach is a prerequisite. In the X-curve used to describe transitions, soil and land stakeholders are given a framework, which provides perspective for action, specifically for science and governance stakeholders in each phase of the transition. This framework can provide the required intensive guidance to (1) analyze the impact of provided incentives, (2) identify new reference points in the transition and (3) stimulate transition catalysts, and (iv) innovate by testing cutting edge policy instruments in close cooperation with society. The key to make the necessary transitions and realize the SDGs by 2030 lies in the intensive guidance to combining initiatives, steering knowledge flows and continuously assessing the stage of the transition, in order to plan specific steps needed to progress in the transition framework. Both scientist and policy makers have an important role in this guidance.

TI  - Fostering urban transformations in Latin America: lessons around the ecological management of an urban stream in coproduction with a social movement (Buenos Aires, Argentina)
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Collaborative community-based approaches are proposed as a way to overcome the difficulties exerted by a broad range of social-ecological traps that emerge at the reconfiguration of social-ecological systems onto sustainable paths. Despite this, a deep examination of the social-ecological processes and interactions that constrain these approaches in different urban contexts is still necessary to improve their success. Latin American countries have institutional, political, and social characteristics that could constrain the pathways to sustainability in different ways from countries of the Global North, particularly in their metropolitan areas. Here, we present an experience (2015-2018) held in cooperation with workers of a social cooperative framed in an urban social movement from Argentina, related to the ecological rehabilitation of a highly degraded urban stream through the management of the riparian vegetation and the reintroduction of native macrophytes. The methodology involved a co-design approach based on a set of participatory action-research tools, together with resilience system analysis through causal loop diagrams, and three different interventions of a 200-m reach at the upstream area of the San Francisco stream (Buenos Aires, Argentina). The participatory diagnostic showed a strong negative effect of the current management guidelines on the riparian and aquatic vegetation, reflecting a positive feedback loop that reinforces this negative state, and revealed a hierarchical governance regime associated with the management of the watershed. Furthermore, it detected a strong motivation of local workers to generate transformative actions in terms of the sanitary and social-ecological improvements of the local habitat. The management actions showed a relatively high short-term survival of the macrophyte transplants (30-60% in a period of 2-4 months), displaying a strong spatial structure of the survival units, and downscaling to about 10% in the long term (6-12 months after interventions). A combination of biophysical and social processes related both to institutional and rigidity traps affected the survival of the transplants, reflecting the inertia of the current management programs to ecological improvements of the stream. In summary, the present work highlights the social-ecological constraints arising from transformative collective actions toward the ecological management of a stream at a highly vulnerable and bureaucratic urban context, with implications for social-ecological urban transformations in Latin America and the design of effective participatory governance actions in alliance with local social movements.

TI  - The geography of socio-technical transitions: Transition-periphery dynamics
T2  - GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The literature on socio-technical transitions analyses multi-scale, nonlinear changes in societal systems, but has tended to ignore the geography of these changes. This paper addresses this gap by focusing on a geographical periphery, rather than on the urban core, and considers a transition-periphery framework to provide a way to conceptualise and examine the dynamics of resource peripheries within a socio-technical transition. The concepts of socio-technical transitions and resource peripheries have been connected in previous work examining wind energy projects in Scotland. This study extends that work by refining its framework, explicitly drawing from the concept of peripheralisation as a process, and applying the framework to a wider set of contexts. The focus of peripheralisation is on the processes involved in creating peripheries rather than simply the periphery as a geographic location. This attention to peripheralisation uncovers the multi-dimensional, relational, and multi-scalar relationships and processes of the dynamics within resource peripheries during a socio-technical transition. This paper draws on a set of energy policy case study sites in Scotland, including the North Yell Tidal Scheme, the proposed Shetland interconnector, and the Cruachan and Coire Glas Pumped Hydro schemes. It argues that transition-periphery dynamics are an effective analytical tool for understanding the geographically uneven multi-scalar dynamics created as socio-technical transitions occur.

TI  - Operationalising transformative sustainability science through place-based research: the role of researchers
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Among scholars in sustainability science, there is an increasing recognition of the potential of place-based research in the context of transformative change towards sustainability. In this research, researchers may have a variety of roles; these are determined by the researcher's engagement with the subject, the inherent theoretical, normative and methodological choices he or she makes, the researcher's ambitions in contributing to change, and ethical issues. This article explores the varied roles of research fellows within the European Marie Curie ITN research program on sustainable place-shaping (SUSPLACE). By analysing 15 SUSPLACE projects and reflecting on the roles of researchers identified by Wittmayer and Schapke (Sustain Sci 9(4):483-496, 2014) we describe how the fellows' theoretical positionality, methods applied, and engagement in places led to different research roles. The methodology used for the paper is based on an interactive process, co-producing knowledge with Early Stage Researchers (fellows) of the SUSPLACE consortium. The results show a range of place meanings applied by the fellows. Varied methods are used to give voice to participants in research and to bring them together for joint reflection on values, networks and understandings, co-creating knowledge. Multiple conceptualisations of 'sustainability' were used, reflecting different normative viewpoints. These choices and viewpoints resulted in fellows each engaging in multiple roles, exploring various routes of sustainable place-shaping, and influencing place-relations. Based on our findings we introduce a framework for the 'embodied researcher': a researcher who is engaged in research with their 'brain, heart, hands and feet' and who integrates different roles during the research process.

TI  - Studying transitions: Past, present, and future
T2  - RESEARCH POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The domain of transition studies has been drawing more and more scholarly attention and, as a result, its body of knowledge is rapidly growing. This raises new challenges as well as opportunities, not the least regarding the methodological and philosophical underpinnings of research in this domain. In this respect, transition research, as a relatively young field of inquiry, has been little concerned with methodological investigation and reflection. We propose a framework that enables this reflection: the so-called 'transition research onion'. Subsequently, we utilize this framework to systematically assess 217 peer-reviewed papers in the field of transition studies, to distill key methodological patterns and trends of the field. The findings suggest that the methodology of transition studies, in terms of depth and diversity, is underdeveloped. These insights serve to guide future research on transition processes.

TI  - Public attitudes toward urban water sustainability transitions: a multi-city survey in the western United States
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents an integrated theoretical model, drawing from sustainability transition research and attitude theory, to explain public perceptions of urban water sustainability transitions and public support for transformational water-management strategies. We test the model with empirical data from a random-sample residential survey in three cities in the western United States dependent on Colorado River water: Phoenix, Arizona, Denver, Colorado, and Las Vegas, Nevada. As one of the most heavily managed and over-allocated transboundary river systems in the world, sustainable water management of the Colorado River is critical to the future of the region. Cities face increasing pressure on water resources as population, development, and uncertainty about the future increase. While a growing number of scholars focus on sustainability transitions, a few studies focus explicitly on the role of the public as fundamental actors. This is despite the acknowledgement that public support may constrain or enable transitions and that major societal changes will affect the public in numerous and critical ways. We hypothesize that environmental orientation, procedural knowledge, perceived personal responsibility, trust in government, and socio-economic resources predict public perceptions of the need for transitions and public support for transformational water-management strategies. We use ANOVA to identify differences between cities, and confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling to evaluate the conceptual model. Results provide partial support for the hypothesized model and the findings replicate across cities. The findings suggest several policy implications for basin-wide and city-scale water management in the Colorado River basin.

TI  - Towards more effective and transferable transition experiments: learning through stratification
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We argue that the increasing use of experimental approaches in transition and transformational research on potential sustainability solutions could substantially profit from application of the principles of stratification and stratified experimental design. We illustrate our proposition with three worked examples of hypothetical transition experiments and argue that the use of stratification can produce three essential benefits in transition experiments: (1) increased methodological validity and better comparability of experimental results, (2) potential scalability of sustainability solutions tested, and (3) better assessment of potential transferability of sustainability solutions to other systems. Moreover, stratification and stratified design of transition experiments might be employed to address some of the recently raised criticisms regarding reproducibility of results and the appropriate use of statistical methodology in scientific experimentation in general and transition experimentation in particular.

TI  - One transition, many transitions? A corpus-based study of societal sustainability transition discourses in four civil society's proposals
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - When the civil society makes 'transition' its label, it cannot be assumed that different civil society actors share compatible varieties of localist or radical transformationists discourses. This study has comparatively analyzed the discourses in four civil society sustainability transition proposals using a corpus-based methodology. We found that the proposals are similar as they identify the economy as an object and an entry point for transition, frame the economy as embedded in the socio-ecological system, ascribe agency to grassroots movements for transitions from the bottom-up. We also found crucial differences among the discourses regarding the role of the State, the degree of reform or radical innovation, the degree of imaginative character of the sustainability vision, the degree of opposition to capitalism. We suggest that insights on how the civil society employs notions of transition with respect to the themes of politics, emotions and place can help advance theorizations and practices of societal sustainability transitions led by the civil society.

TI  - Transformative innovation policy for solar energy: particularities of a developing country
T2  - CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of transformative policies and how they can promote the spread of a technology connects interests among different actors such as government, industry, and academia, who seek solutions for the use of renewable energy, among them solar energy. This study investigates transformative innovation policy for the solar PV energy in Brazil from a sociotechnical perspective of innovation and suggests ways to better promote this technology in Brazil. This study was based on data from two different information sources: (1) in-depth interviews with actors in the Brazilian national innovation system; and (2) secondary data from energy sector in Brazil. With an analysis that is unprecedented for Brazil, the study presents a proposal for transformative innovation policies for the sociotechnical transition process of solar energy in Brazil. The results indicate the need for incentive policies to develop the Brazilian domestic solar panel industry across the whole value chain, as well as for the definition of policies to encourage technological innovation and the formation of cooperation networks among the actors of the system as key elements to promote and disseminate this technology in Brazil.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Diagnosing Barriers and Enablers for the Flemish Energy Transition
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Industrialised economies are currently confronted with the challenge of transitioning to a low-carbon energy system. Starting from the insight that 'system innovation' rather than incremental change is needed, we diagnose barriers and enablers for energy system transformation for the case of Flanders (Belgium). We thereby combine multiple perspectives: a techno-economic perspective to derive a technology-based vision on the energy transition, a technology innovation perspective to assess barriers and enablers regarding the upscaling of technological niche-innovations, and a system innovation perspective to address fundamental barriers and enablers associated with transformative system change. We highlight the complementary features of the three perspectives and describe how insights can feed into the development of energy transition pathways.

TI  - Exploring green and sustainable chemistry in the context of sustainability transition: The role of visions and policy
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN GREEN AND SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Review
AB  - With the aim of using more environmentally benign chemical products and processes, a wide and global transition toward green and sustainable chemistry is required to solve sustainability issues from the production, use, and end of life of chemicals. We argue that for the effective development of a green and sustainable chemical industry, the integration of common visions toward sustainability (e.g., smaller, flexible chemical plants using renewable feedstock including waste, intensive dialog and cooperation with stakeholders, prevalence of product-service systems) along with the implementation of tailored policies built on the precautionary principle for supporting the emerging industries (e.g., tax exception, public procurement, etc) and withdrawing support for the traditional ones (e.g., redirecting R&D funding, carbon trading, etc.) are indispensable.

TI  - Dialogue with property owners and property developers as a tool for sustainable transformation: A literature review
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Review
AB  - The housing sector is important for achieving ambitious environmental targets. In the European Union, buildings account for 40% of energy consumption and 36% of CO2 emissions. Considering the scale of the housing sector's environmental impact, interventions in how new housing is built and existing housing is renovated have great potential for sustainable transformation. However, the sector has not been timely in implementing energy-efficiency measures, as it has a conservative culture with established actor roles that require renewal, and a lack of interest in environmental issues. Drawing on the identified literature, this article reviews the research examining the interactions of property-owning and property developing actors with municipalities. Particular attention is paid to the utilization of dialogue processes in projects targeting sustainable urban development. Based on the reviewed literature, this article identifies barriers to and enablers of such dialogues, as well as the factors that promote their success. The study finds that the following research avenues should be explored further: the causality between innovation and dialogue processes; the mobilization of interests among stakeholders; the links between dialogue and consensus; the effects of socio-cultural context on dialogue and project outcomes; and the impact of process leadership on dialogues.

TI  - Towards urban water sustainability: Analyzing management transitions in Miami, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - As climate change challenges the sustainability of existing water supplies, many cities must transition toward more sustainable water management practices to meet demand. However, scholarly knowledge of the factors that drive such transitions is lacking, in part due to the dearth of comparative analyses in the existing transitions literature. This study seeks to identify common factors associated with transitions toward sustainability in urban water systems by comparing transitions in three cases: Miami, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles. For each case, we develop a data-driven narrative that integrates case-specific contextual data with standardized, longitudinal metrics of exposures theorized to drive transition. We then compare transitions across cases, focusing on periods of accelerated change (PoACs), to decouple generic factors associated with transition from those unique to individual case contexts. From this, we develop four propositions about transitions toward sustainable urban water management. We find that concurrent exposure to water stress and heightened public attention increases the probability of a PoAC (1), while other factors commonly expected to drive transition (e.g. financial stress) are unrelated (2). Moreover, the timing of exposure alignment (3) and the relationship between exposures and transition (4) may vary according to elements of the system's unique context, including the institutional and infrastructure design and hydro-climatic setting. These propositions, as well as the methodology used to derive them, provide a new model for future research on how cities respond to climate-driven water challenges.

TI  - Steering the 'C-Day': Insights from the rapid, planned transition of the UK's natural gas conversion programme
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article studies the steering strategies pursued during a major sociotechnical transition in the then state-owned British gas industry. We focus on the ten-year (1967-1977) national project to convert 35 million appliances to run on natural gas instead of manufactured gas. The article : a. addresses the issue of steering in the multi-faceted, complex process of conversion and identifies the context of and challenges faced by the natural gas conversion programme in the 1960s and how actors responded and coordinated action; b. Identifies modes of steering followed by key actors and institutions of the period; c. Identifies essential precursors for this successful steering, including: the recognition of the challenges the industry faced in the pre-transition years; an openness to experimentation, R&D and organizational and technical change; and harmonious relations with government. We argue that the steering approach needs to combine an emphasis on planning and institutional and regulatory innovation with aspects of the mundane governance approach. Our analysis shows, with reference to the UK's low-carbon gas transition, that while rapid, planned transitions are achievable, they may require complex, demanding forms of steering and governance that may prove hard to achieve in today's socioeconomic and political conditions.

T2  - SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There is an increasing interest in the role of actors in the pursuit of sustainability transitions. In this paper, we adopt a life course perspective to explore active sustainability actors. To this end, we interviewed 16 professionals across private, public, and third sectors in Finland. The paper's main implication is in introducing a life course perspective to the study of active sustainability actors. Second, we propose a grounded model of active actors' sustainability engagement. The model details sustainability agency formation and maintenance dynamics. Going forward, our findings are a call for further research on sustainability agency, be it in its engagement, via life courses, or via the study of different actor types.

TI  - Long-Term Electricity Scenarios for the MENA Region: Assessing the Preferences of Local Stakeholders Using Multi-Criteria Analyses
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, most countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), including Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia, have rolled out national policies with the goal of decarbonising their economies. Energy policy goals in these countries have been characterised by expanding the deployment of renewable energy technologies in the electricity mix in the medium term (i.e., until 2030). This tacitly signals a transformation of socio-technical systems by 2030 and beyond. Nevertheless, how these policy objectives actually translate into future scenarios that can also take into account a long-term perspective up to 2050 and correspond to local preferences remains largely understudied. This paper aims to fill this gap by identifying the most widely preferred long-term electricity scenarios for Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia. During a series of two-day workshops (one in each country), the research team, along with local stakeholders, adopted a participatory approach to develop multiple 2050 electricity scenarios, which enabled electricity pathways to be modelled using Renewable Energy Pathway Simulation System GIS (renpassG!S). We subsequently used the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) within a Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) to capture local preferences. The empirical findings show that local stakeholders in all three countries preferred electricity scenarios mainly or even exclusively based on renewables. The findings demonstrate a clear preference for renewable energies and show that useful insights can be generated using participatory approaches to energy planning.

TI  - Socio-technical transitions to sustainability: a review of criticisms and elaborations of the Multi-Level Perspective
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - This article discusses the socio-technical transition literature, particularly the Multi-Level Perspective, which investigates the fundamental changes in (energy, transport, housing, agro-food) systems that are needed to address persistent sustainability problems. The article positions the MLP within the wider academic debate on sustainability transformations, and reviews criticisms and seven recent elaborations of the MLP with regard to: (1) politics and power, (2) cultural discourse and framing struggles, (3) grassroots innovation, (4) multiple transition pathways, (5) incumbent firm resistance and reorientation, (6) destabilization and decline, (7) policy analysis. Mobilizing insights from the wider social sciences, these elaborations have nuanced and differentiated the understanding of socio-technical transitions to sustainability and made the MLP the central pillar of a multi-facetted, cumulative research programme with a broad empirical evidence base.

TI  - Shaping Unconventional Gas Regulation: Industry Influence and Risks of Agency Capture in Texas, Colorado and Queensland
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND PLANNING LAW JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Unconventional gas has quickly become a significant energy resource and a site of contestation over the nature and outcome its regulatory processes. Central to this contest are issues of power and capture and the implications for achieving sustainable energy regulation. The influence of dominant industry players can be a serious obstacle for transitions beyond established energy regimes, and can negatively affect the sustainability of energy policy and implementation. Drawing on interviews across three case studies in Texas, Colorado and Queensland, this article examines perceptions of unconventional gas regulators and regulations. It finds a general view from interviewees that economic interests within the unconventional gas industry have influenced regulation, and that this influence is a significant explanation for the failures of regulation and policy to address a number of environmental and societal concerns. Variations are identified between the cases in terms of the extent of possible industry influence, but all three cases reveal common points of vulnerability, including economic arrangements, suboptimal organisational structures, expertise imbalances, limited agency funding and "revolving doors" of staff. The findings suggest that fully addressing these challenges through law alone will be difficult, and instead highlights three governance pathways that could be pursued beyond state law to achieve more effective and sustainable unconventional gas governance.

TI  - Just Transformations to Sustainability
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - Transformations towards sustainability are needed to address many of the earth's profound environmental and social challenges. Yet, actions taken to deliberately shift social-ecological systems towards more sustainable trajectories can have substantial social impacts and exclude people from decision-making processes. The concept of just transformations makes explicit a need to consider social justice in the process of shifting towards sustainability. In this paper, we draw on the transformations, just transitions, and social justice literature to advance a pragmatic framing of just transformations that includes recognitional, procedural and distributional considerations. Decision-making processes to guide just transformations need to consider these three factors before, during and after the transformation period. We offer practical and methodological guidance to help navigate just transformations in environmental management and sustainability policies and practice. The framing of just transformations put forward here might be used to inform decision making in numerous marine and terrestrial ecosystems, in rural and urban environments, and at various scales from local to global. We argue that sustainability transformations cannot be considered a success unless social justice is a central concern.

TI  - The black box of power in polycentric environmental governance
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Failure to address unsustainable global change is often attributed to failures in conventional environmental governance. Polycentric environmental governance-the popular alternative-involves many centres of authority interacting coherently for a common governance goal. Yet, longitudinal analysis reveals many polycentric systems are struggling to cope with the growing impacts, pace, and scope of social and environmental change. Analytic shortcomings are also beginning to appear, particularly in the treatment of power. Here we draw together diverse social science perspectives and research into a variety of cases to show how different types of power shape rule setting, issue construction, and policy implementation in polycentric governance. We delineate an important and emerging research agenda for polycentric environmental governance, integrating diverse types of power into analytical and practical models.

TI  - Futures of sustainability as modernization, transformation, and control: a conceptual framework
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last three decades, sustainability has become a guiding principle for states, organizations, companies, and social movements as well as a general ideal for social change. While sustainability seems to be a rather inevitable path of development, there is no consensus over the goals and visions of the future associated with this concept. Proponents of a Green Economy, for instance, regard economic growth as a prerequisite for sustainable development and advocate a modernization of society, which implies moderate adjustments toward a sustainable economy within the current institutional framework. Critics of this ecological modernization approach see the imperative of economic growth as an obstacle for sustainable development and instead support a fundamental transformation of society. A third perspective tries to solve the problems of sustainable development with wide-ranging politics of control, using concepts such as ecological state of emergency or enforcing resilience measures for vulnerable populations while creating safe enclaves for a privileged few. These three possible ideal typical trajectories of social changemodernization, transformation, and controlare not fixed yet, but rather represent different and highly contested imaginaries of the future. These imaginaries then structure distinctive practices of sustainability in the fields of politics, the economy, civil society, and science. These practices in turn are interdependent with specific structures, such as material infrastructures or the ecological system of the earth. The proposed conceptional framework uses the theoretical concepts of imaginaries, practices, and structures to study the possible futures of sustainability, specifically modernization, transformation, and control, as well as possible interdependencies between these developments. It focuses on sustainability as a sociological category indicative for understanding socioeconomic change, the emergence of new conflicts, inequalities, hierarchies, and justification patterns that result from including sustainable criteria into different fields, institutions, and value systems. Deciphering futures of sustainability does not aim at providing prognoses or forecasts, but intents to work out an analytical concept that asks how contemporary societies change when they are guided by imaginaries of sustainability.

TI  - Nature-Based Solutions for Urban Climate Change Adaptation: Linking Science, Policy, and Practice Communities for Evidence-Based Decision-Making
T2  - BIOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nature-based solutions offer an exciting prospect for resilience building and advancing urban planning to address complex urban challenges simultaneously. In this article, we formulated through a coproduction process in workshops held during the first IPCC Cities and Climate Science Conference in Edmonton, Canada, in March 2018, a series of synthesis statements on the role, potential, and research gaps of nature-based solutions for climate adaptation and mitigation. We address interlocking questions about the evidence and knowledge needed for integrating nature-based solutions into urban agendas. We elaborate on the ways to advance the planning and knowledge agenda for nature-based solutions by focusing on knowledge coproduction, indicators and big data, and novel financing models. With this article, we intend to open a wider discussion on how cities can effectively mainstream nature-based solutions to mitigate and adapt to the negative effects of climate change and the future role of urban science in coproducing nature-based solutions.

TI  - An agenda for sustainability transitions research: State of the art and future directions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on sustainability transitions has expanded rapidly in the last ten years, diversified in terms of topics and geographical applications, and deepened with respect to theories and methods. This article provides an extensive review and an updated research agenda for the field, classified into nine main themes: understanding transitions; power, agency and politics; governing transitions; civil society, culture and social movements; businesses and industries; transitions in practice and everyday life; geography of transitions; ethical aspects; and methodologies. The review shows that the scope of sustainability transitions research has broadened and connections to established disciplines have grown stronger. At the same time, we see that the grand challenges related to sustainability remain unsolved, calling for continued efforts and an acceleration of ongoing transitions. Transition studies can play a key role in this regard by creating new perspectives, approaches and understanding and helping to move society in the direction of sustainability.

TI  - Passing the baton: How intermediaries advance sustainability transitions in different phases
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, increasing attention has been paid to intermediaries, actors connecting multiple other actors, in transition processes. Research has highlighted that intermediary actors (e.g. innovation funders, energy agencies, NGOs, membership organisations, or internet discussion forums) operate in many levels to advance transitions. We argue that intermediation, and the need for it, varies during the course of transition. Yet, little explicit insight exists on intermediation in different transition phases. We integrate existing conceptual models on transition dynamics and phases and a typology of transition intermediaries to examine how intermediaries advance transitions in different phases. We illustrate our conceptual insights through examples from car clubs, heat pumps and low-energy housing. We conclude that intermediation is paramount from predevelopment to stabilisation of a transition. Intermediary functions change from supporting experimentation and articulation of needs in predevelopment, to the aggregation of knowledge, pooling resources, network building and stronger institutional support and capacity building in acceleration.

TI  - Comparing energy transitions in Germany and Spain using a political economy perspective
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - During the 2000s, Germany and Spain were forerunners in Europe's energy transition. However, after the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2007 a growing divergence in the two countries' energy policy paths can be observed. This article applies a political economy perspective to explore the reasons for this divergence. In investigating this empirical puzzle, the work identifies two main causes of the differing developments in the two countries. The first cause being that Spain was hit much harder by the financial and economic crisis and the second, that the Spanish energy transition was an elite-driven process whereas the German Energiewende was driven by large sectors of civil society. Regarding the theoretical question of how to understand the divergent developments of the countries' energy politics, a perspective based on regulation theory and Antonio Gramsci's political theory can help offer an understanding of the social character of energy transitions.

TI  - Seedbeds, harbours, and battlegrounds: On the origins of favourable environments for urban experimentation with sustainability
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban experimentation (UE) is seen as crucial for enacting transformations towards sustainability. Research in this domain has flourished, but still lacks theoretical coherence. We review this emerging literature, combining methods for problematisation and critical interpretive synthesis, to address two questions: how does the extant literature conceive of the contexts in which experimentation emerge, and what dynamics are thought to be implicated in reconfiguring these contexts into favourable environments for UE? Traditionally, transition studies assume that cities may act as protective spaces for experimentation, but recent studies suggest other salient dynamics. We identify three lenses - seedbeds, harbours, and battlegrounds - which articulate the assumptions and dynamics associated with different understandings of the urban context. We argue for plural accounts of how UE thrives in particular places and offer a way 'to follow' the coevolution between a multiplicity of experiments and their environment, through interactions between protection, connectivity, and conflict.

TI  - Research on agro-food sustainability transitions: A systematic review of research themes and an analysis of research gaps
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Agro-food sustainability transitions refer to fundamental changes necessary to move towards sustainable agriculture and food systems. The young field of research on sustainability transitions in agro-food systems is still largely ill-defined. In order to delineate its contours, this paper provides a critical review of the main research themes and highlights research gaps. A search carried out on Scopus in January 2018 yielded 549 records and 111 research articles were included in the systematic review. Research gaps were identified through an analysis of the alignment of the research field with the research agenda of the Sustainability Transitions Research Network (STRN) and its research themes i.e. implementation strategies for managing transitions; power and politics; civil society, social movements and culture in transitions; role of industries and firms in transitions; transitions in everyday life and practice (sustainable consumption); geography of transitions; and modelling transitions. The strand of research on agro-food sustainability transitions is multifaceted and diverse; it addresses all the themes of the STRN's research agenda. However, it focuses on transition management and sustainable consumption, while it largely underserves the themes dealing with the role of civil society and firms in transitions as well as the geography of transitions. Therefore, research on agro-food sustainability transitions should fill research gaps relating to agency (cf. role of social movements and civil society, firms and industries, etc.) and spatiality/geography in transitions. The paper suggests that these two research topics should be addressed in an articulated research agenda that accommodates the peculiarities of sustainability transitions processes in the agro-food system.

TI  - Determining the factors of household energy transitions: A multi-domain study
T2  - TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Energy transitions at the household level are important because there are so many households, and motives and barriers to these transitions processes are not well understood. The objective of this paper is to investigate explanatory variables of household energy transitions. We select papers investigating explanatory variables underpinning household energy transitions in three domains: adoption of solar photovoltaics (PV) in households, adoption/transition to sustainable residential heating systems (RHS) and adoption/transition to alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs). In all three domains the chosen literature employ a wide variety of quantitative analyses such as discrete choice models ranging from multinomial logic models and principal component analysis to qualitative assessment of the answers through inductive analysis. The explanatory variables are categorized in six super-ordinate explanatory variable categories of economic factors, environmental factors, personal preferences and values, social factors, household characteristics and market and policy factors. In total we identify 31 explanatory variables which have been investigated in the 38 articles chosen, falling under the six categories. Investment cost is an important explanatory variable for all three domains, but a policy variable such as government subsidy could mitigate the former explanatory variable. We propose a conceptual framework as an initial step towards understanding the interactions and impacts of the explanatory variables with each other.

TI  - Advancing the use of scenarios to understand society's capacity to achieve the 1.5 degree target
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - With a range of potential pathways to a sustainable future compatible with the Paris Agreement 1.5 degrees C target, scenario analysis has emerged as a key tool in studies of climate change mitigation and adaptation. A wide range of alternative scenarios have been created, and core amongst these are five socio-economic scenarios (Shared Socio-economic Pathways or SSPs) and four emission scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways or RCPs). Whilst mitigation scenarios (the Shared Policy Assumptions, or SPAS) have been developed for each SSP-RCP combination, describing the actions necessary to match the climate pathway of the RCP, there has not yet been a systematic approach to address whether and how these actions can be enabled in practice.We present a novel and transferable framework to understand society's capacity to achieve the 1.5 degrees C target, based on four participatory case studies using the SSP-RCP scenarios. The methodology builds on a framework for categorising different types of societal capitals and capacities and assessing their impact on the potential to implement different types of mitigation actions. All four case studies show that SSP1 has the highest potential to reach the target. Although environmental awareness is high in both SSP1 and SSP4, continued social inequalities in SSP4 restrict society's capacity to transform, despite economic growth. In the two least environmentally-aware SSPs, SSP3 and SSP5, the transformation potential is low, but the view on capitals and capacities nonetheless helps identify opportunities for actors to develop and implement mitigation actions.The study highlights that techno-economic assessments of climate strategies need to be complemented by consideration of the critical role played by social and human capital, and by societal capacity to mobilise and create these capitals despite different socio-economic trends. These capitals and capacities are essential to enable the rapid innovation, behavioural change and international co-ordination needed to achieve the 1.5 degrees C target.

TI  - Food and nutrition security and sustainability transitions in food systems
T2  - FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY
M3  - Review
AB  - The concepts of food security and food sustainability are two main paradigms in the food system discourse-however, they are often addressed separately in the scientific literature. We argue that this disconnect hinders a coherent discussion of sustainability transitions, which will be necessary to solve problems (environmental, social, economic, and health) generated by conventional food systems. Our review highlights linkages between sustainability transitions and food and nutrition security using the perspective of sustainable food systems. We explore the diversity of food security narratives and food sustainability paradigms in the agro-food arena, analyze relations between food security and food systems sustainability, and suggest options to foster a transition toward sustainable food systems. It is widely acknowledged that food systems sustainability must entail long-term food and nutrition security in its availability, access, utilization, and stability dimensions. For food systems to deliver food and nutrition security for present and future generations, all their components need to be sustainable, resilient, and efficient. These linkages between food sustainability and food and nutrition security intersect at global, national, local, and household levels. Different strategies can be pursued to foster sustainability transitions in food systems: efficiency increase (e.g., sustainable intensification), demand restraint (e.g., sustainable diets), and food systems transformation (e.g., alternative food systems). Creating sustainable food systems requires moving from an agriculture-centered to a food system policy and research framework. This will be fundamental to foster the complex and holistic transformation necessary to achieve sustainable food systems, which is, in turn, a prerequisite to achieving sustainable food and nutrition security.

TI  - A critical review of discursive approaches in energy transitions
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
M3  - Review
AB  - This article critically reviews the use of discursive approaches in studies of sustainable energy transitions. The review is motivated by calls to further incorporate social scientific methodologies into energy research and assess their contribution to policy. We strive to answer three questions: (1) which discursive approaches have been used to study sustainable energy transitions; (2) what thematic topics and issue areas have been covered and (3) what is the added value of discursive research designs? Our analysis is based on a review of 77 articles from the years 2004-2016. Our findings show that discursive approaches were mostly used to analyse institutional change and policy strategies at the national level and to examine energy choices through political ideology and the perceptions of publics. Nuclear power received most coverage, while renewable energy technologies were mainly studied through conflicts and opposition. We demonstrate discursive research designs to examine four distinct policy areas and discuss the added value of these approaches for energy policy and research. Discursive methodologies enable scholars to enrich policy discussions through accounting for transitions as complex and dynamic processes of change.

T2  - RESEARCH POLICY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 50th Anniversary Conference of the Science-Policy-Research-Unit (SPRU)
CL  - Univ Sussex, Brighton, ENGLAND
AB  - This paper presents an analytical framework for assessing the emergence of a new policy paradigm labelled "transformative innovation policy", which can be seen as layered upon, but not fully replacing, earlier policy paradigms of science and technology policy and innovation systems policy. The paper establishes conceptual diversity in this emerging policy paradigm. Despite a common agenda for transformative change, there are notable differences concerning the understanding of the innovation process. Two global initiatives to promote such new innovation policies, Mission Innovation and the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, are used to illustrate how different articulations of transformative innovation policy are expressed in practice. These may be seen as a positive expression of the breadth of the emerging policy paradigm. While there are grounds for such a positive reading, this paper ends with a caution by stressing the political nature of paradigm change and the strong legacy of an economic, firm-centred and technology-oriented tradition in innovation policy. It makes a plea for more emphasis on a broader conceptualization of transformative innovation, and suggests that a socio-technical understanding of innovation provides several appropriate analytical concepts that can help to shape our thinking and understanding of transformative innovation policy.

TI  - (IM-)Material flow analysis for system innovation
T2  - MATERIAUX & TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Current assessment tools are mainly disciplinary and support the assessment of material flows in terms of environmental impacts or economical flows, for example. These tools provide helpful quantitative information for system (re)-design but do not explicitly question the value creation factors and their embeddedness in a specific socio-spatial context. This article underlines that innovation for sustainability requires more complexity and a system and multidisciplinary approach. A dynamic material and immaterial resource flows model coupled with extended scorecard to support both the analysis and structuration of territorial projects may be of great support to better understand, qualify and quantify the different kinds of resources revealed, mobilized or denied during a project. This communication focuses on the model development and the cross-fertilization of industrial, sociological and geographical disciplines for system transition analysis. Even if this model is still under development, it appears to strengthen strategic analysis, as it enables both the representation of the tangibles and intangible assets mobilized during the emergence and structuration of territorial projects (e.g. business model transition to functional economy) and sustainability assessment of existing projects (e.g. industrial and territorial ecology projects).

TI  - Ecosocial Innovations and Their Capacity to Integrate Ecological, Economic and Social Sustainability Transition
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article contributes to sustainability transition research by indicating the significance of transformative grassroots innovations in the context of social work research. We introduce the integrative concept of ecosocial innovation in order to demonstrate how grassroots innovations can successfully combine social, ecological and economic aspects of a sustainability transition. By ecosocial innovations, we refer to social innovations with a strong ecological orientation (e.g., recycling workshops, urban gardening, participatory unemployment projects and new local economies). The data consists of 50 examples of ecosocial innovations in Finland, Italy, Germany, Belgium and the UK. We investigate how ecosocial innovations interconnect ecological, economic and social goals and study the factors of their integrative crucial capacity. On the basis of qualitative data analysis and thematic categorisation of ecosocial innovations, we identify five integrative practices: diversity of activities, successful networking, addressing new livelihood, focus on food and explicit conceptual work on sustainability. Very often these integrative practices emerge as pragmatic solutions to local needs. For the participants, the ecosocial innovations can be relevant sources for new livelihood and wellbeing beyond the conventional labour market. Foremost, ecosocial innovations are valuable as forerunners for sustainability transition in practice.

TI  - Advancing sustainable consumption and production in cities - A transdisciplinary research and stakeholder engagement framework to address consumption-based emissions and impacts
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban consumption patterns and lifestyles are increasingly important for the sustainability of cities today and in the future. However, considerations of consumption issues, social norms, behaviour and lifestyles within current urban sustainability research and practices are limited. Much untapped potential for the reduction of the environmental footprint of cities exists in combined production and consumption-based approaches, particularly in the "demand" areas of mobility, housing, food, and waste. To change unsustainable consumption and production patterns in cities, research needs to be transdisciplinary, actively involving stakeholders through co-creation processes. This paper builds on the premise that the perspectives and approaches of Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) for cities require the involvement of non-traditional stakeholders that are generally not included in urban planning processes such as social change initiatives, citizen groups and informal sector representatives. We present a transdisciplinary research and engagement framework to understand and advance the transition to sustainable SCP patterns and lifestyles in cities. This transdisciplinary approach to SCP transformations in cities combines co-creation, participatory visioning processes and back-casting methods, participatory urban governance and institutional change, and higher-order learning from small-scale community initiatives. We illustrate our conceptual framework through three empirical case studies in cities which take an integrative approach to lowering ecological footprints and carbon emissions.

TI  - Sustainability through institutional failure and decline? Archetypes of productive pathways
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although current literature on sustainability governance and institutions is preoccupied with innovation, novelty, success, and "best practice," there is an emergent tendency to consider decline and failure as opportunities and leverage points to work toward and to achieve sustainability. However, although failure, crisis, and decay have been treated extensively, the link toward their productive potential has remained underdeveloped in the literature. Using a systems perspective, we described five archetypical pathways through which crisis, failure, deliberate destabilization, and active management of decline may facilitate sustainability transformation through adaptation, learning, providing windows of opportunity, and informed choices regarding stability versus change. We sought to provide a basis for further conceptual and empirical inquiry by formulating archetypical pathways that link aspects of failure to productive functions in the sense of sustainability. We started out by describing five archetypical pathways and their conceptual underpinnings from a number of different literatures, including evolutionary economics, ecology, and institutional change. The pathways related to (1) crises triggering institutional adaptations toward sustainability, (2) systematic learning from failure and breakdown, (3) the purposeful destabilization of unsustainable institutions, (4) making a virtue of inevitable decline, and (5) active and reflective decision making in the face of decline instead of leaving it to chance. These archetypical pathways were illustrated by a number of sustainability-related empirical case studies. In developing these archetypes, we have sought to move forward the debate on sustainability transformation and harness the potential of hitherto overlooked institutional dynamics.

TI  - Co-creating urban green infrastructure connecting people and nature: A guiding framework and approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green infrastructure (UGI) and nature-based solutions are increasingly recognized as instruments to address urban sustainability challenges, yet rely on a good understanding of complex social-ecological system (SES) to function adequately. Adaptive co-management (ACM), engaging a broad variety of stakeholders in collaborative learning, is an effective strategy to improve the resilience of a SES. However, ACM studies have been criticized for neglecting the urban context, while also offering little clarity on process objectives and outcomes. To address these knowledge gaps, while also drawing attention to the important issue of socially inclusive UGI development, we present a guiding framework and approach to encourage the ACM of UGI featuring two main components. Firstly, a Learning Alliance (LA) serves as an instrument for collaborative learning and experimentation across different scales. To facilitate upscaling, we propose to establish a complementary Urban Learning Lab (ULL) to facilitate a regular exchange between the LA and legitimate peripheral networks and stakeholders in the city region. Secondly, a stepwise approach to SES analysis serves to engage a representative group of stakeholders in the LAs and ULLs, and support the processes of setting LA objectives and monitoring of adaptive capacity. We illustrate our approach to the ACM of UGI with a case study of LivadaLAB in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Applying the framework and approach, we demonstrate increased adaptive capacity of the SES around UGI as indicated by: 1) improved overall stakeholder salience, in particular for previously disempowered actor groups, 2) increased number and strength of connections between stakeholders, and 3) the consideration of a broader range of sustainable development objectives by stakeholders in their daily practice.

TI  - The Role of Law in Transformative Environmental PoliciesA Case Study of "Timber in Buildings Construction in Germany"
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last decades, environmental law has significantly contributed to limiting the environmental impacts of our mode of living. Yet environmental problems still prevail and are strongly linked to our production and consumption systems. Therefore, the current challenges must be tackled with a systemic approach. The concept of transformative environmental policy identifies approaches for policymakers to interfere in socio-economic systems in order to give them a more sustainable structure. This article seeks to identify the contributions that law can make to a transformation towards sustainability. For illustrative purposes, I point out the concrete steps in a case study on increasing the use of timber in buildings construction in Germany. I argue that law plays a role in all three phases of a transformation/transition. The legal framework must enable innovations and experiments in the first transformation phase, come up with restricting regulations for old non-sustainable structures in the second phase, and in the third phase provide course stability for the new system. I conclude that the concept of transformative environmental policy helps to design adaptations of the legal framework in order to transform socio-economic and socio-technical systems towards more sustainability.

AB  - In this Special Issue, we interrogate and evaluate the concept of institutional work in the domain of environmental governance, by bringing together diverse papers spanning a range of substantive and theoretical approaches. The papers apply the concept of institutional work across fields of regional development, water governance, climate change adaptation, and urban planning, and disciplines of planning, sociology, political science, geography, and anthropology. As a whole, the Special Issue contributes to a growing body of literature exploring the role of agency in processes of institutional change. This has implications for environmental governance scholarship, which emphasises the role of institutions across all scales from local to global and to understanding transformations in governance systems within which institutional change plays a central role.

T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - During the past decade, sustainability science has rapidly developed into a globally well-recognized and important new science of the 21st century. However, sustainability science has not received much attention from scientists and practitioners in China where sustainable development and ecological civilization have been prominent themes. To promote the development of sustainability science in China, Wu, et al. (2014) published the first in-depth review on the subject in Chinese, entitled "What is sustainability science?" Here, we revisit the question, and discuss the relationship between sustainability science and sustainable development research, the scientific paradigm and the core research questions of sustainability science. Our review of the recent advances in this field reveals contrasting trends for the world versus China. On the one hand, the world is witnessing sustainability science maturing with global momentum to systematically advance sustainability research and education. On the other hand, China greatly lags behind developed countries and South Africa, albeit the great deal of new passion and desire for sustainable development. To promote the science and practice of sustainability in China, we propose a trinity strategy: 1) "bringing in" from the global community to guide Chinese practices in sustainable development; 2) "reaching out" to the global community to share Chinese wisdom of sustainable development; and 3) "integrating traditional Chinese philosophy with western science" to lead the development of sustainability science.

TI  - Planners between the Chairs: How Planners (Do Not) Adapt to Transformative Practices
T2  - URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Even though the turn to practice is widely accepted in the field of urban planning, the practices of planners are empirically largely unexplored. Looking at the daily routines and practices of urban planners thus allows a deeper insight into what planning is, and how planning practices are related to innovation and transformation. To do so, we start from the assumption that behaviour is a constellation of practices, including certain activities, a set of choices and actions, patterns of behaviour or forms of interaction that is organised in a certain space or context by common understandings and rules. By conducting an online survey among planners in medium-sized German cities, we first identified a wide range of planning practices and activities in general. In a second step, we conducted a statistical cluster analysis resulting in six types of planners: (1) the 'local-specific analysts,' (2) the 'experienced generalists,' (3) the 'reactive pragmatists,' (4) the 'project-oriented planners,' (5) the 'compensatory moderators,' and (6) the 'innovative designers.' Each cluster has specific practices and activities, linked to characteristic value-sets, role interpretations and self-perceptions that might help explain the differences with regard to innovation and transformation. From the identified six groups or clusters of planners, only two clusters more or less consequently aim at innovation, experimentation and new approaches. One cluster is dedicated to collaborative practices whereas traditional practices predominate in three clusters at least, mainly because of legal requirements. This is the result of an increasing 'formalisation' of land-use planning, making planners focus on technical and formal practices, and, at the same time, lead to the reduced 'attention' to and implementation of conceptual approaches or 'necessary' transformative practices, including proactive approaches and strategic coordination with regard to sustainable urban development, but also comprising experiments, real labs or social innovations.

TI  - The Resilience of Sustainability Transitions
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Finding ways to understand, analyze, and manage sustainability transitions is a fundamental challenge for sustainability science. In this paper, we show how we can substantially deepen our understanding of factors that determine the success of sustainability transitions by combining two key concepts from the resilience literaturestability and adaptabilitywith a dynamic understanding of the progress of socio-technical transitions. We propose a conceptual perspective for sustainability transitions, the resilience of sustainability transitions (RST) concept, which integrates progress, stability, and adaptability as key dimensions to comprehend the dynamics of sustainability transitions. In a case analysis of the energy transition process in the Austrian region of Weiz-Gleisdorf, we apply the concept. In doing so, we illustrate how RST thinking helps identify and understand crucial elements that influence the dynamics of a sustainability transition process.

TI  - Analysing the Role of Visions, Agency, and Niches in Historical Transitions in Watershed Management in the Lower Mississippi River
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyses five major transitions in watershed management in the Lower Mississippi River from the early 19th century to the present. A conceptual framework is developed for analysing the role of visions, agency, and niches in water management transitions and applied to a historical case on water management in the Lower Mississippi River. It is shown that water management regimes change over time and that major transitions were preceded by niches, in which new visions were developed and empowered. The case shows that: (i) emerging visions play an important role in guiding transitions; (ii) agency enables the further diffusion of visions and niches; (iii) vision champions play an important role in transitions, but are not decisive; (iv) each transition has led to an extension of the number of societal functions provided, which has led to more complex water management regimes in which functions are combined and integrated; and (v) external landscape factors are important, as they can lead to awareness and urgency in important decision making processes.

TI  - Unpacking social-ecological transformations: Conceptual, ethical and methodological insights
T2  - ANTHROPOCENE REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Social-ecological systems contribute to environmental change and, in turn, face its corresponding shocks and disturbances. As scholarship on resilience and social-ecological transformations grows, researchers from various disciplines continue to debate how major transitions and environmental change can be anticipated, studied or guided towards just and ethical outcomes. To this end, we apply an interdisciplinary perspective to describing key aspects of social-ecological transformations scholarship around three pressing questions: (1) What features or criteria distinguish transformations from other forms of change?; (2) What are the political, ethical, and normative concerns associated with transformations?; and (3) How can we better track, measure, and evaluate such transformations? Our insights, which emerged from a workshop with early-career interdisciplinary scholars, highlight questions of justice, equity and ethics in transformations research, and suggest that more precise indicators of change, a more explicit understanding of system boundaries, and a dual focus on process and outcomes will help advance our understanding of the social-ecological implications of transformations. We hope that articulating these challenges and recommendations in an interdisciplinary framing will help further the conversation on these critical topics and provide an accessible perspective of key considerations for multidisciplinary scholarship on social-ecological transformations.

TI  - Transition Management for Improving the Sustainability of WASH Services in Informal Settlements in Sub-Saharan Africa-An Exploration
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper explores how transition management processes can be designed to address the unsustainability of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services in informal settlements in cities in Sub-Saharan Africa. The unsustainability of services related to WASH in informal settlements in Sub-Saharan Africa is deeply embedded in current societal and governance structures, cultures, and practices; it is context-dependent and involves numerous actors with different interests. Based on a literature review and empirical work in Arusha (Tanzania), Dodowa (Ghana), and Kampala (Uganda), we identify five context dimensions that account for the unsustainability of WASH services: (a) multiplicity of WASH practices, structures, and arrangements; (b) governance capacities for WASH services and maintenance; (c) landownership for sustainable access to WASH; (d) public participation in decision-making related to WASH; and (e) socio-economic inequalities governing access to WASH. These dimensions pose numerous conceptual and application challenges for transition management. Based on these challenges, recommendations are formulated for the design of a contextualized, participatory transition management process that is not only functional, but also emancipatory.

TI  - A discursive-institutional perspective on transformative governance: A case from a fire management policy sector
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Scholarship around questions of climate change adaptation is increasingly concerned with ideas of transformative adaptation and its governance through critical re-evaluation of beliefs, values and associated institutions. For public policy sectors, the concept of transformative governance brings attention to their capacities for supporting and engaging in such governance. While much adaptation research and practice informs technical and structural understandings of these capacities (e.g., governance arrangements, learning systems and adaptation planning), most of this research (and practice) has ignored less formal, yet equally important dimensions of public administration and governance. Institutional scholarship highlights that dominant norms, beliefs, and philosophical ideas underpin how policy sectors structure their policy responses and engagement in governance. Discursive Institutionalism suggests that examining a sector's dominant discourse can provide insights into these institutional logics. This paper therefore argues that understanding a policy sector's institutional logics is a crucial part of working toward enabling transformative governance of adaptation. This argument is developed through a case study of the institutional logics operating in the fire management policy sector of Victoria, Australia, and the potential influence of these logics on that sector's capacities to engage in transformative governance. Findings suggest this sector's institutional logics may currently constrain its capacities to engage in transformative governance and highlight the need for greater attention to socioinstitutional dimensions of public administration to help catalyze transformative governance of (and for) adaptation.

TI  - A Sustainability Lighthouse-Supporting Transition Leadership and Conversations on Desirable Futures
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Central in leadership for sustainability transitions is the capability to create transformative momentum in a sustainable (desirable) direction, calling for meaningful conversations on sustainable futures. The aim of this study is to develop a conceptual framework to inspire and support such conversations. A qualitative literature review of sustainability conceptualizations was conducted, followed by a thematic analysis. The resulting framework consists of an overarching question and an accompanying set of categories for four sustainability dimensions: the social, the economic, the ecological, and human needs and wellbeing'. Furthermore, the framework is visualized as a lighthouse for pedagogical reasons. We foresee that the lighthouse might be of value in processes guiding socio-technical transitions towards sustainability in three different ways: (1) by attempting to bridge the issue of transition' with that of sustainability'; (2) as part of a backcasting process; and (3) modes of transdisciplinary research where relevant actors take part in the conversation. The study is related to over 20 years of experience from working with a backcasting approach engaging with sustainability transitions in a variety of processes. We invite further dialogue on how one may approach the concept of sustainability to inspire and support conversations on sustainable futures.

TI  - Leading from the Niche: Insights from a Strategic Dialogue of Renewable Energy Cooperatives in The Netherlands
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Renewable energy cooperatives envision and manifest an alternative way of organising within the energy system (and beyond). Yet, despite their growth, it is uncertain whether such initiatives are able to increase and deepen their impact, leading the transition to an environmentally sustainable and socially just energy system. This paper presents insights from a strategic dialogue co-organised with the Dutch national interest group of renewable energy cooperatives "ODE Decentraal". We used transition management as action research methodology to organise the dialogue to understand and support the transformative potential of the cooperative energy movement. The dialogue helped to clarify the challenges and possibilities for scaling energy cooperatives beyond the niche, supporting at the same time the participants to reflect, strategize and develop a shared transition agenda. This contribution presents and analyses our intervention and its impact, also specifically evaluating the potential of transition management to facilitate social learning processes, reflexivity and the development of strategic actions. Our intervention confirmed the hypothesis that actors in the niche often focus too much on the competition with the regime for individual goals, thereby failing to collectively strategize and engage with incumbent regimes in a systematic way.

TI  - Model-Based Exploration of Co-Creation Efforts: The Case of Solar Photovoltaics (PV) in Skane, Sweden
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Co-creation in the societal sphere is becoming important in many parts of the world. However, empirical analysis of co-creation in local energy transitions has been understudied. This paper aims to contribute to the field of local energy transitions by integrating a model-based approach with the municipal co-creation efforts in a local energy transition setting. The study uses a mixed-methods approach, with both quantitative and qualitative methods underpinning the approach. A System Dynamics (SD) model is built to analyse the feedback loops created by the co-creation efforts of the municipalities in Skane, Sweden to increase the uptake of household solar photovoltaics. Simultaneously, the model is conceptualized and built in coordination with the municipality actors, and qualitative validation provided by them. An iterative process is implemented, consisting of three steps: interaction with the municipality actors (MAs), developing the causal relationships between the model variables and model development. The suggestions and discussions with the MAs were very useful in understanding the social factors and processes which help in the diffusion of a technologically innovative product, such as solar PV. The MAs said that they found the explanation of the modelling variables useful in undertaking the co-creation efforts.

TI  - Achieving Global Climate and Environmental Goals by Governmental Regulatory Targeting
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Strategic niche management and transition management have been promoted as useful avenues to pursue in order to achieve both specific product or process changes and system transformation by focusing on technology development through evolutionary and co-evolutionary processes, guided by government and relevant stakeholders. However, these processes are acknowledged to require decades to achieve their intended changes, a timeframe that is too long to adequately address many of the environmental and social issues many industrialized and industrializing nations are facing. An approach that involves incumbents and does not consider targets that look beyond reasonably foreseeable technology is likely to advance a model where incumbents evolve rather than being replaced or displaced. On the other hand, approaches that focus on creating new entrants could nurture niche development or deployment of disruptive technologies, but those technologies may only be marginally better than the technologies they replace. Either approach may take a long time to achieve their goals. Sustainable development requires both radical disruptive technological and institutional changes, the latter including stringent regulation, the integration of disparate goals, and changes in incentives to enable new voices to contribute to new systems and solutions. This paper outlines options for a strong governmental role in setting future sustainability goals and the pathways for achieving them.

TI  - Transformation Is 'Experienced, Not Delivered': Insights from Grounding the Discourse in Practice to Inform Policy and Theory
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Calls for transformation, transformative research, and transformational impact are increasingly heard from governments, industry, and universities to recast a course towards sustainability. This paper retraces a social, qualitative, and interpretive research endeavor to contribute to broadening the conceptual base of transformation. Drawing on perspectives of practitioners involved in working with communities to bring about change in how land and water are managed, the objective of the research was to elicit a range of practice-based encounters of transformation to inform policy and theory. In identifying precursors and processes for change, the findings bring into view the often unseen internal and experiential dimensions of transformation. As such, the research provides insights on where transformation takes place, what the first step of transformation might look like, and what might be deemed transformational. The paper also builds on social practice theory to produce an explanatory model of transformational capacity that is enabled and constrained by structures, processes, understanding, and authority that impact on social practices of knowledge generation (including science) and land and water decision-making.

TI  - The demographics of decarbonizing transport: The influence of gender, education, occupation, age, and household size on electric mobility preferences in the Nordic region
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many researchers, policymakers and other stakeholders have explored and supported efforts to transition towards more sustainable forms of low-carbon mobility. Often, discussion will flow from a narrow view of consumer perceptions surrounding passenger vehicles-presuming that users act in rationalist, instrumental, and predictable patterns. In this paper, we hold that a better understanding of the social and demographic perceptions of electric vehicles (compared to other forms of mobility, including conventional cars) is needed. We provide a comparative and mixed methods assessment of the demographics of electric mobility and stated preferences for electric vehicles, drawing primarily on a survey distributed to more than 5000 respondents across Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. We examine how gender influences preferences; how experience in the form of education and occupation shape preferences; and how aging and household size impact preferences. In doing so we hope to reveal the more complex social dynamics behind how potential adopters consider and calculate various aspects of conventional mobility, electric mobility, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) systems. In particular, our results suggest that predominantly men, those with higher levels of education in full time employment, especially with occupations in civil society or academia, and below middle age (30-45), are the most likely to buy them. However, our analysis also reveals other market segments where electric vehicles may take root, e.g. among higher income females and retirees/pensioners. Moreover, few respondents were orientated towards V2G, independent of their demographic attributes. Our empirical results can inform ongoing discussions about energy and transport policy, the drivers of environmental change, and deliberations over sustainability transitions.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The port of Rotterdam is a global leader in the fossil fuel economy, with a 50% market share for fossil fuel products in North-Western Europe. Although it is one of the most efficient and innovative ports globally, over the last decade it has seen a gradual increase of pressures on its activities and the need to develop alternative low-carbon strategies. This paper describes how a turbulent energy context, growing societal pressure and a change in the leadership of the Port Authority opened up space for a transition management process. The process impacted the business strategy and the discourse amongst its leaders and contributed to the set-up of a transition unit and a change in investments. It subsequently led to an externally oriented transition arena process with incumbent actors in the port area and actors from outside around the transition pathway to a circular and bio-based economy. By exploring how transition management could support the repositioning of incumbent actors in the energy transition, the research contributes to discussions in the transitions literature on regime destabilisation, the role of (incumbent) actors in transitions, and large-scale energy-intensive industries as the next frontier in the energy transition.

TI  - Transition without Conflict? Renewable Energy Initiatives in the Dutch Energy Transition
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of the slowly progressing energy transition, a number of renewable energy initiatives have been emerging in the Netherlands. These initiatives represent alternatives to the dominant functioning of the energy system, and as such, may come into conflict with it. Transitions involve system destabilisation and conflict between the incumbent regime and the initiatives originating in niches. In order to assess the transformative potential of such initiatives, this paper addresses the question: what kind of conflicts and tensions arise from renewable energy initiatives, and what strategies do they develop to overcome or avoid them? Combined with a business model perspective, transition thinking enabled a better understanding of how the initiatives organise themselves, and where the points of friction with their institutional context emerge. We suggest that the instances of conflict may function as an indication for the state of the energy transition and the transformative potential impact of such initiatives. The instances discussed in this contribution relate to existing support schemes, technology choices, and the overall organisational networks of the emerging sector.

TI  - Sustainability Transitions and the Spatial Interface: Developing Conceptual Perspectives
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainability transitions research lacks a crucial perspective: the spatial dimension. The interrelations between space and sustainability transition processes are thus underexposed. The spatial dimension is, of course, implicitly addressed in transition research but it often remains unclear which spatial concept is used and how the spatial conditions are embedded in the transition processes. This paper approaches the problem in two steps: (1) analysing the various understandings of transitions research and their implications for different spatial concepts relating to spatial sustainability transition; and (2) focusing on different spatial concepts (from a positivist mode to relational and socio-cultural approaches) and their reflections in different disciplines of social, natural and technical sciences as well as in practice. By identifying the links between sustainable transition approaches on the one hand and spatial conceptualizations on the other hand, this paper aims at deepening both the spatial perspective and the understanding of sustainable transition research. The results of this paper are three conceptual perspectives wherein space or spatial conceptualizations can provide added value for sustainability transition research in inter- and transdisciplinary modes. These three perspectives include (1) space as a bridging concept, (2) space as a normative concept, and (3) space as an approach to action.

TI  - Co-Creation Dynamics in Urban Living Labs
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Citizens and urban policy makers are experimenting with collaborative ways to tackle wicked urban issues, such as today's sustainability challenges. In this article, we consider one particular way of collaboration in an experimental setting: Urban Living Labs (ULLs). ULLs are understood as spatially embedded sites for the co-creation of knowledge and solutions by conducting local experiments. As such, ULLs are supposed to offer an arena for reflexive, adaptive, and multi-actor learning environments, where new practices of self-organization and novel (infra-) structures can be tested within their real-world context. Yet, it remains understudied how the co-creation of knowledge and practices actually takes place within ULLs, and how co-creation unfolds their impacts. Hence, this paper focuses on co-creation dynamics in urban living labs, its associated learning and knowledge generation, and how these possibly contribute to urban sustainability transitions. We analyzed empirical data from a series of in-depth interviews and were actively involved with ULLs in the Rotterdam-The Hague region in the Netherlands. Our findings show five distinct types of co-creation elements that relate to specific dynamics of participation, facilitation, and organization. We conclude with a discussion on the ambivalent role of contextualized knowledge and the implications for sustainability transitions.

TI  - Thinking complex interconnections: Transition, nexus and Geography
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF BRITISH GEOGRAPHERS
M3  - Article
AB  - More than ever is Geography surrounded by interdisciplinary movements claiming expertise with regard to the interconnections among nature, society and technology. These movements ask questions from Geography and geographers about if and how they can contribute to those movements and what form collaboration might take. This paper analyses Human Geography's interactions with research on sustainability transitions since the early 2000s to think through future interactions between Geography and research on the water-energy-food nexus. It shows that concepts, ideas, logics and methods have travelled from Human Geography into Transition Studies but that exchange between them has so far been partial and asymmetrical. Arguing that common ideas about how interdisciplinarity can be encouraged might be insufficient to change this situation, the paper develops ideas from Stengers, Whitehead, Foucault and others to explain the relations between Human Geography and Transition Studies in terms of modes of abstraction in an evolving ecology of power relations. It makes a case for slowing down modes of abstraction and proposes some ideas for slow collaborative research on sustainability transitions in contact zones. Implications for how Geography and geographers might engage with interdisciplinary nexus research are outlined.

TI  - The potential contribution of transition theory to the analysis of bioclusters and their role in the transition to a bioeconomy
T2  - BIOFUELS BIOPRODUCTS & BIOREFINING-BIOFPR
M3  - Review
AB  - Biocluster initiatives have become an important tool for governments to establish, promote, and strengthen economic collaboration, learning, innovation, and employment within particular regions. However, in addition to issues like competitiveness and employment, bioclusters operate with the additional goal of fostering the transition to a sustainable bioeconomy. The profound changes that are required for a successful shift from a fossil-based economy to a bioeconomy are called transitions and the relatively new scientific field of transition theory has emerged to study them. The aim of this paper is to show the contribution that transition theory can make to the study of bioclusters. In this paper I will review frameworks from the study of sustainability transitions (multi-level perspective and technical innovation systems) and frameworks from theories of evolutionary economic geography and cluster studies (regional and sectoral innovation systems). The review shows how the choice of a particular framework will shape the analysis of the biocluster through the particular focus and delineation associated with each framework. The review shows the advantages and disadvantages these frameworks have for incorporating the various issues related to the shift towards a bioeconomy that are currently neglected in the literature on bioclusters.

TI  - Designing transformative spaces for sustainability in social-ecological systems
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Transformations toward sustainability have recently gained traction, triggered in part by a growing recognition of the dramatic socio-cultural, political, economic, and technological changes required to move societies toward more desirable futures in the Anthropocene. However, there is a dearth of literature that emphasizes the crucial aspects of sustainability transformations in the diverse contexts of the Global South. Contributors to this Special Feature aim to address this gap by weaving together a series of case studies that together form an important navigational tool on the "how to" as well as the "what" and the "where to" of sustainability transformations across diverse challenges, sectors, and geographies. They propose the term "transformative space" as a "safe-enough" collaborative process whereby actors invested in sustainability transformations can experiment with new mental models, ideas, and practices that can help shift social-ecological systems onto more desirable pathways. The authors also highlight the challenges posed to researchers as they become "transformative space-makers," navigating the power dynamics inherent in these processes. Because researchers and practitioners alike are challenged to provide answers to complex and often ambiguous or incomplete questions around sustainability, the ideas, reflections and learning gathered in this Special Feature provide some guidance on new ways of engaging with the world.

TI  - Exploring a transition in Dutch healthcare
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose - Healthcare systems are facing persistent challenges, such as dealing with an ageing population, related increases in chronic diseases and healthcare costs facilitated by technological progress. The authors argue that the boundaries of optimisation are being reached and a more fundamental change or transition is necessary. The purpose of this paper is to explore the contours of this transition in the Netherlands. The authors do this from the perspective of healthcare organisations that have participated in the Expedition to Sustainable Healthcare: a learning programme organised by the Dutch Network for Sustainable Healthcare aimed at creating frontrunners in this transition.Design/methodology/approach - The paper combines conceptual with experimental empirical work. The authors use the transition research frameworks to conceptualise persistent problems and transitional dynamics in the healthcare system. In a longitudinal study, the authors analysed how the participating organisations developed after the expedition.Findings - The process validated the initial understanding of persistent sustainability challenges. An integral approach to sustainable healthcare is translated as a transformation of culture, structures and practices and the development of capacity for crossing borders and domains, inside and outside of the organisation. To facilitate and stimulate such a process the authors found that problem structuring and collective identification of persistent problems and the unsustainability in the healthcare system is a crucial step towards a shared view and discourse that supports change.Originality/value - A transition in the Dutch healthcare system is just starting to emerge and has barely been subject of research. This paper provides an empirical description of a transition management process in this context. The authors hope to lay a foundation for future work that seeks to explore transitions in healthcare in theory and practice.

TI  - Innovation Systems for Transformations towards Sustainability? Taking the Normative Dimension Seriously
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this article is to complement research on transformations towards sustainability by drawing upon the innovation systems (IS) framework. The IS framework already serves as a suitable and influential basis for research on processes of technological innovation and economic change. We argue that improving the capacity of an IS framework for dealing with wicked problems and the normative complexity of sustainability requires a fundamental paradigm shift because in the current IS paradigm innovations are considered as per se desirable and in mostly technological terms. Therefore, we call for IS dedicated to transformations towards sustainability by opening up for systemic innovations beyond the technological dimension and by acknowledging that stakeholders have conflicting visions, interests, norms, and expectations with regard to sustainability goals. Taking the normative dimension of transformations towards sustainability seriously thus requires more explicit and integrative research on directionality, legitimacy, responsibility, and their interrelation in IS. The article concludes by proposing suggestions for future research based on IS-related approaches that can serve as building blocks for an IS framework capable of incorporating legitimate goal-orientation for transformative innovation by and for society.
