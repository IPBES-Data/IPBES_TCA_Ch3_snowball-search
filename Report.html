<p>They requested the following:</p>
<h2 id="task-1">Task 1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Search for all references the key-references
<strong>cites</strong></li>
<li>Search for all references the key-references is
<strong>cited</strong> in</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="task-2">Task 2</h2>
<p>Two additional papers were provided by the authors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Håkon Aspøy, Yennie K. Bredin, Berit Junker-Köhler, David N. Barton,
Inventory of behaviour science theories potentially influencing
biodiversity decision making Deliverable number: D1.2, Norwegian
Institute for Nature Research (NINA)</li>
<li>Waddock, Fazwy in review (attached): PLEASE DO NOT SHARE,
CONFIDENTIAL</li>
</ul>
<p>Of these additional references, the authors requested the following:
- extract list of references cited in the two additional papers</p>
<h2 id="task-3">Task 3</h2>
<p>Quantify the <strong>local impact</strong> of the cited references in
the key-papers by counting how often the reference is cited in the
respective key-paper.</p>
<h2 id="task-4">Task 4</h2>
<p>Quantify the <strong>global impact</strong> of the references the
key-paper <strong>cites</strong> as well as the refererences where the
ke-paper is <strong>cited</strong> in by counting the number each of
these papers is cited globally and dividing it by the time since
publication of the respective paper.</p>
<h1 id="methods">Methods</h1>
<h2 id="task-1-1">Task 1</h2>
<h3 id="key-references-cites-references">key-references cites
references</h3>
<p>The references were manually downloaded from the Web of Science and
are saved in different formats in the folder
<code>./Task 1/Scopus</code>. It is not expected to be different when
downloading these from the Web of Science.</p>
<h3 id="key-references-is-cited-in">key-references is cited in</h3>
<p>The references were manually downloaded from the Web of Science and
are saved in different formats in the folder
<code>./Task 1/WoS</code>.</p>
<h2 id="task-2-1">Task 2</h2>
<p>The references in Aspøy et al and Waddock &amp; Fazwy were extracted
by: - copying the references out of the pdf and cleai=ning the text -
converting the formated references into different formats using <a
href="https://rintze.zelle.me/ref-extractor/">Reference Extractor</a>
resulting files are stored in the folder ./Task 2/`</p>
<h2 id="task-3-1">Task 3</h2>
<p>The <strong>local importance</strong> is determined by counting the
number of times a reference is cited in a key-paper. This is done
by:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>converting the key-papers into a single text file
(<code>./Task 3/....txt</code>)</li>
<li>extract all citations in paper by extracting all
<code>[...]  or</code>(…)<code>, depending on citation style (</code>./Task
3/… - extracted [].txt`)</li>
<li>clean the text files to remove regular brackets and expand e.g [1-3]
to [1], [2], [3]
(<code>./Task 3/... - extracted - cleaned.txt</code>)</li>
<li>extracting the references cited in the key-papers and convert them
usinf the same approach as for Task 2
(<code>./Task 3/... - ref.csv</code>)</li>
<li>use the script in `./Task 3/References cited how often in
four.qmd</li>
<li>resulting files are saved in
<code>./Task 3/... - citation occurances.csv</code>. The columns are:
<ul>
<li><strong>first Number</strong>: Internal number</li>
<li><strong>ref</strong>: Reference number of the cited reference in the
key-paper</li>
<li><strong>Freq</strong>: Number of times the reference is cited in the
key-paper</li>
<li><strong>citation</strong>: The complete citation of the
reference</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>## Task 4 The <strong>global importance</strong> is determined by
counting the number of times a reference is cited in a key-paper. For
this, an automated script is required that automatically reads the
number of times cited.</p>
